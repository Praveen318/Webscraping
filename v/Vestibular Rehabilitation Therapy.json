Vestibular rehabilitation therapy helps you manage dizziness symptoms, including imbalance. To understand how therapy works, it may help to know more about why you may feel very dizzy and how your body manages balance.DizzinessDizziness happens when something affects your sense of spatial orientation. Spatial orientation is your brain calculating the position of your body in relation to your surroundings. When that happens, you may feel woozy or lightheaded. You also may feel unsteady, as if you\u2019ve lost your sense of balance.BalanceYour sense of balance relies on the relationship between your central nervous system (brain) and your sensory system. Your sensory system includes:Your vestibular labyrinth in your inner ear: This includes your semicircular canals (loops), which react when you turn your head, and otolith organs that react to gravity and movement.Your vision: Your eyes send your brain impulses that show where your body is in relation to other objects.Your skin, joints and muscles: When your body moves, it puts pressure on your tissues. Your tissues send signals to your brain, telling it where your body is in relation to space. For example, if you\u2019re standing up and you lean back, you put pressure on tissues in the back of your foot and lower leg. That pressure lets your brain know you\u2019re leaning instead of standing straight.Your central nervous system pulls this information together so it can tell your body how to maintain balance. When something interferes with the system\u2019s connection, your central nervous system can\u2019t process information correctly. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy helps restore those connections, ultimately reducing your symptoms of dizziness and imbalance.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
