They work by making your vaginal tissue more flexible or elastic. They can also help to strengthen pelvic floor muscles that have become loose or weak.Some of the health conditions that can cause painful intercourse are:Menopause: Menopause causes several hormonal changes that can make sex painful.Vaginismus: Vaginismus causes muscle spasms during intercourse or penetration.Dyspareunia: Dyspareunia is the medical term for persistent pain in your genital area during or after intercourse.Previous radiation therapy or surgery for cancer: Radiation and surgery for certain types of cancer can affect your vaginal tissue. Dilators can help give this damaged tissue its flexibility and softness.Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: MRKH is a condition that causes a person to be born without a fully developed vagina, making intercourse difficult.Congenital conditions that affect your vagina or hymen: Treatment for congenital conditions (conditions from birth) that cause your vagina to have a small opening may involve using a vaginal dilator.Vaginal stenosis: Vaginal stenosis causes your vaginal opening to close or narrow due to scarring or hormonal changes.Gender affirmation therapy: Dilators can help support medical or surgical procedures that reconstruct your vagina.Where can I get a vaginal dilator?Vaginal dilators are available over-the-counter (OTC) through many online retailers and pharmacies. But you should still talk to a healthcare provider before you use one. They can help determine if it\u2019s the right therapy for you or recommend a size and brand.Procedure DetailsHow do you choose a vaginal dilator?Dilators range in length from about 2 inches to 7 inches (in). The circumference, or thickness, also varies from about 0.5 inches to 1.5 inches. The goal is to work your way up to a larger and/or thicker dilator. If treatment is working, you should notice you\u2019re able to more easily insert a larger dilator over time. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t try to rush through sizes or force yourself to wear a larger dilator before you\u2019re ready.Vaginal dilators come in plastic or silicone and resemble the shape of a penis. Both materials have their pros and cons. Plastic tends to be more firm and rigid, which may help stretch your vagina. But some people find it uncomfortable. Silicone is softer, gentler and more flexible. You can also use a silicone dilator chilled or warmed. It\u2019s important to find one that feels comfortable to you but also provides enough tension to stretch your vagina.Magnetic vaginal dilators are another option. They\u2019re made of plastic, but they have a magnet inside which may help increase blood flow to further aid in healing vaginal tissue.Some dilators are sold with a handle, wand or finger loop which gives you greater control over the dilator when you move it around inside your vagina.Your healthcare provider may be the best person to recommend which dilator to get. They can perform a pelvic exam or physical exam to see what type and size vaginal dilator will work best for you.AdvertisementHow do you put a vaginal dilator in?Inserting a dilator can be slightly uncomfortable at first. The process of putting in and using a dilator shouldn\u2019t take more than 20 minutes. The benefit of this type of therapy is that you can do it in the privacy and comfort of your own home.Here are the steps to help you use a vaginal dilator:Apply a water-based lubricant (like KY\u00ae or Astroglide\u00ae) to the dilator. Don\u2019t use oil-based lubricants or products like Vaseline\u00ae. Remember, you should use a small dilator to start and work your way up over time.Lay in a comfortable position on your back with your legs bent at the knees. Allow your legs to fall outward if possible, similar to how you would during a pelvic exam.Insert the dilator into your vagina similarly to how you\u2019d insert a tampon (at a downward angle toward your spine). You should feel tension and the dilator should feel snug without causing pain. Once you feel this tension, stop. Don\u2019t force it in further.Often, your provider will recommend doing Kegel exercises with your dilator in to help relax your pelvic floor. Taking long, deep breaths can also help relax your muscles.Spend the next five minutes moving the dilator around while it\u2019s inside your vagina. This part is easier to do if your dilator has a handle or \u201cholder\u201d with it. Rotate the dilator in circles towards the front, rear and sides of your vagina. Then, move it in and out (similar to what occurs during penetration).Gently remove the dilator after 15 minutes.Clean your dilator with gentle soap and warm water.

You should start with a dilator that feels snug but isn\u2019t painful to insert. This is where talking to your healthcare provider is helpful because they can recommend what size to start with.Over time, you should be able to graduate to larger dilators. These may be labeled large, extra-large or size seven, for example. The largest vaginal dilator is meant to replicate an erect penis, so it can be about 7 in long and 1.5 in thick.Many manufacturers sell vaginal dilators in kits or packs that include several sizes. This can remove the guesswork because you have all the sizes you may need. As always, you should discuss dilator treatment with your healthcare provider to make sure you\u2019re using it correctly.How long should you keep a vaginal dilator in?You should keep a vaginal dilator in for about 10 to 15 minutes each time.
