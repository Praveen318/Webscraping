The vulva includes the external genitalia associated with those who are designated female at birth (DFAB). A vulvoplasty creates the parts of a vulva \u2014 the mons, the clitoris, and the outer and inner labia \u2014 out of tissue that is associated with being designated male at birth (DMAB).For many people who are transgender or nonbinary and DMAB, a vulvoplasty changes the appearance of their genitals so that the way they look matches their understanding of their gender, or gender identity, better. A vulvoplasty is just one option for trans and nonbinary DMAB people who want to live more comfortably as their authentic selves.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhy are vulvoplasties done?A vulvoplasty can help if you feel uncomfortable with the appearance of your genitals. Choosing to get a vulvoplasty may be the right choice for you if you\u2019d prefer your genitals to look closer to a vulva. Or, you may choose a vulvoplasty because it\u2019s less invasive and has fewer risks than a vaginoplasty, a surgery that creates a vaginal canal in addition to a vulva. Everyone\u2019s gender journey is different.Who should have a vulvoplasty?A vulvoplasty is a major surgery that isn\u2019t reversible. This is why it\u2019s so important to be sure your surgery doesn\u2019t cause you any harm physically or psychologically. Having a care team that includes surgeons and behavioral health specialists with expertise in transgender care can make it easier to decide whether a vulvoplasty is right for you. They\u2019ll evaluate your physical and mental health to ensure you\u2019re a strong candidate for surgery.Physical Health EvaluationYour provider will do a physical evaluation to be sure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery. Your provider will:Review your medical history.Conduct a thorough physical exam.Order lab tests that show important information about your hormone levels and the health of your organs.Note any infections or prior conditions you may have, treating or helping you manage them as needed.Ensure that you\u2019re drug-free and smoke-free, offering resources and support as needed.Your provider will also talk with you about how having a vulvoplasty will affect your future health and family planning goals. After surgery, you won\u2019t be able to conceive a child biologically. If you want to conceive a child in the future, you can bank your sperm for later use.Behavioral health evaluationYou\u2019ll meet with two different behavioral health specialists, both with expertise in transgender health. They\u2019ll work with you to be sure that having a vulvoplasty is a healthy option for your psychological well-being, too. Topics you discuss may include:Your feelings about the disconnect between the way your body looks and your gender identity.Your experiences of gender acceptance and discrimination in places where you interact with others \u2014 like work, school and at home.Your goals for your vulvoplasty, including the support network and resources you have to help you through your surgery, from preparation to recovery.Your history with behavioral health conditions or mood disorders.Your history with self-harm or other risk-taking activities.Both specialists must submit a letter of support before you can get approved for a vulvoplasty. The letters must confirm that you meet the Word Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) standards of care for surgery. The letters should confirm that:You\u2019ve been undergoing hormone therapy for at least a year unless there are medical reasons that prevented it.You\u2019ve been living in a way that syncs with your gender identity for at least a year.Finally, you\u2019ll need to confirm that you understand what a vulvoplasty involves, including its risks, benefits and costs.

Also, having people who love and support you close by can boost your spirits. And this is also good for your recovery.What happens during a vulvoplasty?The surgery takes about an hour and a half.
