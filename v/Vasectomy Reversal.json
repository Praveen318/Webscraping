It involves blocking the tubes (vas deferens) through which your sperm cells pass into your semen. Sperm cells are reproductive cells in men and people AMAB. During a vasectomy, your healthcare provider cuts and blocks (occludes) your vas deferens.In a vasectomy reversal, your healthcare provider will remove scar tissue from both ends of your vas deferens. They\u2019ll then align the two ends of the tube and sew them together. In some cases, this isn\u2019t possible and your healthcare provider will sew the vas deferens to another structure called the epididymis.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhy is a vasectomy reversal done?If you\u2019ve had a vasectomy, you may wish to reverse the procedure for many reasons, including:You changed your mind. You may want biological children after an initial decision not to have any children or not to have more children.You\u2019re in a new relationship. You may remarry after a divorce or the loss of your wife or partner and wish to start a family.You want to restore fertility. Even if you don\u2019t plan on having more biological children, you may feel more comfortable knowing you\u2019re capable of having children.Pain relief. For a small number of people, a vasectomy causes pain in your testicles. A vasectomy reversal may relieve testicular pain.What is the success rate of reversing a vasectomy?Depending on how many years have passed since your vasectomy, your success rates are 60% to 95% for return of sperm in your ejaculate. Pregnancy is possible more than 50% of the time after a reversal. However, success rates start to decline 15 years after a vasectomy.Other factors contribute to pregnancy chances even if your vasectomy reversal is successful. The age of your wife or partner is important as well as the health of your sperm.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a vasectomy reversal?Before a vasectomy reversal, you should talk to your healthcare provider about the procedure. Your healthcare provider may ask you the following questions:Why do you want a vasectomy reversal?Do you have a history of excessive bleeding or blood disorders?Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics or antibiotics?Have you had any injuries or other surgeries (including hernias) on your groin, including your genitals or scrotum?Your healthcare provider will evaluate your general health, including any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors. Tell them about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that you\u2019re taking, including herbal supplements. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your risk of bleeding.What questions should I ask my healthcare provider before a vasectomy reversal?Your overall health, comfort and safety are important. It\u2019s a good idea to ask your healthcare provider the following questions during your initial meeting (consultation):How many vasectomy reversal procedures have you performed?Do you think the vasectomy reversal will be successful?How do I take care of myself after the procedure?How should I treat pain?When can I start participating in normal activities, exercises and sexual activity again?How should I prepare for a vasectomy reversal?Your healthcare provider may ask you to shave the hair from your entire scrotum or groin area the night before or the morning of your procedure.Don\u2019t use an electric razor on your scrotum. You should only use electric razors to shave your facial hair. They may cause cuts or irritation on your scrotum. A single-blade disposable razor is the best choice.To reduce the risk of infection, thoroughly wash your scrotum and groin the day before and the morning of your vasectomy reversal.What happens during a vasectomy reversal?Your healthcare provider will give you anesthesia so you won\u2019t feel any pain. They may give you general anesthesia, which makes you go to sleep for the duration of the procedure. If they don\u2019t give you general anesthesia, they\u2019ll give you local anesthesia. Local anesthesia doesn\u2019t make you go to sleep but numbs a small area of your body.Once you\u2019re asleep or numb, your healthcare provider will make a small incision (cut) in your scrotum, often in the same place as your vasectomy scar.Your healthcare provider will locate the ends of your vas deferens and identify the blocked areas or the vasectomy site.Then, they\u2019ll pull both ends of your vas deferens out through the incision and remove the scar tissue or blockages, leaving two cut ends of your vas deferens. They will look at the fluid coming from the testicle to make sure sperm is present. If so, they\u2019ll line up the two cut ends of your vas deferens and sew them together under a microscope. If there is no sperm present, they may need to do a more complicated operation where the vas deferens is attached to the epididymis (a structure on top of the testicle that stores sperm). Once either of these repairs is done, they\u2019ll close the incision with stitches.AdvertisementHow long does a vasectomy reversal take?A vasectomy reversal may take up to four hours. Most vasectomy reversals are outpatient procedures, so you can go home the same day you have your surgery.What is a vasoepididymostomy?A vasoepididymostomy is another type of vasectomy reversal.In some cases, blockages occur in other sperm tubes (pathways) in your body. Your healthcare provider may discover these blockages while performing your vasectomy reversal. Your healthcare provider must avoid (bypass) the blockage to restore your fertility.Blockages often occur in your epididymis (ep-uh-did-uh-miss). Your epididymis is a narrow, coiled tube that connects to your testicles. As years go by after your vasectomy, you\u2019re more likely to develop this blockage in your epididymis.After a vasectomy, your testicles still make sperm cells, but your body absorbs them. Over time, your testicles may produce more sperm than your body can absorb, creating pressure in your vas deferens and epididymis. This pressure may cause a tear (rupture), which your healthcare provider may only discover during surgery.Your healthcare provider will perform a vasoepididymostomy to bypass the blockage. It\u2019s sometimes a more challenging procedure than a standard vasectomy reversal, but it\u2019ll increase the likelihood of fertility.What happens after a vasectomy reversal?After your vasectomy reversal is complete, your healthcare provider will cover your stitches with bandages. They\u2019ll stop putting anesthesia into your body to keep you asleep.Healthcare providers will move you to a recovery room, where they\u2019ll wait for you to wake up and monitor your overall health.Once your healthcare providers determine that you no longer need monitoring, they\u2019ll let you go home (discharge you).You should apply ice packs to the area intermittently for at least 24 hours after a vasectomy reversal.OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help provide relief for mild pain. The most common NSAIDs include aspirin (Bayer\u00ae), ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae) and naproxen (Aleve\u00ae). Not everyone can take NSAIDs, so it\u2019s a good idea to check with your provider before use. If you have a lot of pain, your surgeon may prescribe a stronger pain reliever.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule a Vasectomy ReversalFind A Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of a vasectomy reversal?The most important advantage of a vasectomy reversal is that your chances of getting pregnant through sexual intercourse increase.Other advantages to a vasectomy reversal include:Familiar recovery.
