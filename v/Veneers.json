PolicyHow do veneers work?Veneers cover the front surfaces of your teeth to enhance your smile. They work by camouflaging cosmetic flaws.Who needs dental veneers?Anyone who wants to enhance the appearance of their smile can explore veneers. These dental restorations can camouflage:Chipped or broken teeth.Diastema (gaps or spaces in your smile).Stains that don\u2019t improve with teeth whitening.Teeth that are too small.Misshapen teeth.It\u2019s important to note that veneers are only an option if you\u2019re free of extensive cavities and gum disease. If you have serious oral health issues, you should address those first before exploring cosmetic treatments.AdvertisementVeneers vs crowns: What\u2019s the difference?A porcelain veneer only covers the front surface of a tooth to enhance its appearance. A dental crown, on the other hand, covers the entire tooth structure to add strength and protection.Dental veneers are a cosmetic treatment. In other words, they improve your smile, but they don\u2019t necessarily strengthen or repair your teeth. While dental crowns can also improve the appearance of your teeth, their main purpose is to restore teeth that are badly damaged by decay or trauma.Are there different types of veneers?Yes. There are a few different types of veneers, including composite veneers, porcelain veneers, no-prep veneers, and removable veneers.Composite veneersComposite veneers can conceal mild cosmetic issues. Your dentist uses a tooth-colored composite resin \u2014 the same material used for dental bonding \u2014 to achieve the desired results.Porcelain veneersPorcelain veneers can address a number of aesthetic imperfections. These restorations are custom-made to fit your dental anatomy. Before placement, your dentist must remove some enamel from your natural teeth. This roughens your teeth surfaces and helps your new veneers stay in place.No-prep veneersNo-prep or minimal-prep veneers are a less invasive option. Like traditional porcelain veneers, no-prep veneers are custom-made for your smile. However, they require less enamel removal than traditional veneers.It\u2019s important to understand that no-prep veneers still require some enamel removal.No-prep veneers aren\u2019t right for everyone. Ask your dentist if you\u2019re a candidate.Removable veneersRemovable veneers \u2014 also called pop-on veneers or snap-on veneers \u2014 cover your natural teeth to hide imperfections. Like retainers, you can take removable veneers out anytime. Removable veneers can enhance your smile \u2014 but they can make it difficult to eat, and they could have a negative impact on your speech.There isn\u2019t a lot of research available on removable veneers because they\u2019ve only been around for a few years. Ask your dentist if this option is safe for you.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before dental veneer placement?During your initial appointment, your dentist will examine your teeth and gums to determine if you\u2019re eligible for veneers. If you\u2019re a candidate, they\u2019ll prepare your teeth by removing small amounts of enamel. Next, they\u2019ll take impressions of your teeth. A dental lab technician will use these impressions to make your custom veneers. (If you choose composite veneers, dental impressions aren\u2019t needed.)It can take a few weeks for the dental lab to complete your veneers. If necessary, your dentist can place temporary veneers in the meantime. Once the technician finishes your veneers, the lab will ship them to your dentist\u2019s office.What happens during veneer placement?During a second office visit, your dentist will check the shape, color and fit of your veneers, then permanently bond them into place using dental cement. Finally, they\u2019ll check your bite and make any necessary adjustments.If you want to change something about your veneers, like the shape or color, let your dentist know. They\u2019ll work with you and the dental laboratory to ensure that your results are satisfactory.There\u2019s no downtime following veneer placement. People who receive dental veneers can return to normal activities the same day. You can also eat or drink immediately after your appointment, as long as the anesthesia has worn off.Do dental veneers require special care?Brushing, flossing and visiting your dentist regularly are all you need to do to keep your veneers in good working condition. Be sure to use a soft-bristled toothbrush and non-abrasive fluoride toothpaste. Avoid whitening products, as they can scratch your veneers.To make your veneers last, you should also avoid biting directly into hard or crunchy foods like apples, carrots and tough meats. Cut up these foods and chew them with your back teeth.Porcelain veneers are stain resistant, but it\u2019s still a good idea to avoid dark-colored foods and beverages, such as berries, red wine, coffee and tea. These foods and drinks can stain your veneers over time.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dental CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of dental veneers?Dental veneers offer a number of benefits.
