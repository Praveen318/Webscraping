Your provider may recommend valvuloplasty to treat these types of heart valve disease:Mitral valve stenosis.Pulmonary valve stenosis.Tricuspid valve stenosis.Less commonly, providers may use valvuloplasty for aortic valve stenosis. Valvuloplasty can be effective for congenital (present at birth) aortic stenosis in children and young adults. However, in adults with aortic valve stenosis, the aortic valve often narrows again after valvuloplasty. Your provider may use aortic valvuloplasty as a temporary treatment before aortic valve surgery or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). But valvuloplasty isn\u2019t a substitute for a heart valve replacement.What is the difference between a valvuloplasty and valvotomy?There\u2019s no difference between a valvuloplasty and a balloon valvotomy. Balloon valvotomy is another name for valvuloplasty.When healthcare providers use the term \u201cvalvotomy,\u201d they sometimes mean \u201csurgical valvotomy.\u201d A surgical valvotomy is an open heart surgery to cut the valve leaflets, the tissue flaps that open and close to control blood flow.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a balloon valvuloplasty?Your healthcare provider will give you detailed instructions to prepare for a valvuloplasty.

They may choose to do this if you have bleeding risks or need to wait for blood-thinning medicine to wear off.AdvertisementWhat happens after a balloon valvuloplasty?After the procedure, you go to a recovery area. If the catheter went through your groin, you\u2019ll need to wait a few hours before bending your leg.
