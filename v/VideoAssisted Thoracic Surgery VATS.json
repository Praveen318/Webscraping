Healthcare providers insert a thin tube with a tiny video camera on the end (a thoracoscope) into a small incision in your chest.This scope allows your provider to view inside your chest cavity. Your provider inserts surgical instruments into separate small incisions. They use images from the thoracoscope to guide and perform procedures.

PolicyWhat happens before VATS?You should follow your surgeon\u2019s instructions on what to do before the procedure. They may need you to fast (not eat or drink) for a certain period of time before surgery. Your surgeon may ask you not to take certain medications, including vitamins and herbal supplements. You may also need to quit smoking.Before surgery, you may get tests such as:Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC).Heart tests like an electrocardiogram (EKG) or exercise stress test.Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan.Pulmonary function testing.Upper endoscopy or gastrointestinal (GI) X-ray examination (barium swallow).What happens during VATS?VATS takes place in a hospital or surgical center. You receive general anesthesia to sleep through the procedure. You\u2019ll lie on your nonsurgical side during surgery.Depending on the thoracic condition and VATS procedure, your surgeon:Makes several quarter-inch to half-inch incisions in your chest. Or they make a single incision for a uniport VATS (U-VATS) procedure.Inserts the scope device, which sends images of the inside of your chest to a video screen.Inserts surgical instruments into the other incisions.Uses the video images to guide the removal of the diseased tissue or organ.Closes the incisions with removable stitches or staples.AdvertisementWhat is robotic VATS?Some surgeons use robotic technology to perform video-assisted thoracoscopy. Your surgeon views images from the thoracoscope to guide a robotic surgical device that removes tissue or the diseased organ.What happens after VATS?Your surgeon may send tissue to a lab for a biopsy. A specialist examines the tissue for signs of cancer, infection or disease. The findings may indicate a need for additional surgery or treatments.Care at Cleveland ClinicLung Cancer TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of VATS?VATS is a minimally invasive procedure. This means it takes place through small incisions. An open-chest surgery (thoracotomy) takes longer to perform. It requires a large incision to spread open the ribs and access the chest area. As a result, the recovery is often longer and more painful.Benefits of VATS include:Less risk of blood loss that may require a blood transfusion.A shorter hospital stay.Less severe postoperative pain and scarring.Faster recovery of respiratory function.Lower risk of infection or complications.A quicker return to daily activities.What are the risks of VATS?VATS carries a risk of complications like:Arrhythmias.Blood clots and strokes.Bruising.Collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or atelectasis (lung air sacs don\u2019t properly inflate).Damage to nearby glands, organs, nerves or blood vessels.Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen).Infections.Internal bleeding and blood loss.Respiratory problems like pneumonia.Recovery and OutlookWhat is recovery like after VATS?Most people need to spend a few nights in the hospital after surgery. You should carefully follow your discharge instructions. Doing so will promote a healthy recovery and lower your risk of complications.Your at-home recovery may include:Changing surgical dressings regularly.Not driving and staying home from work or school for a designated time.Resting and not lifting anything heavy for a set time.Taking antibiotics, pain relievers or other medications as directed by your provider.What is the outlook for people who have VATS?Your outlook depends on the specific thoracic disorder, your overall health and the success of treatments. Your thoracic surgeon can discuss your prognosis with you based on your unique diagnosis.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call the doctor?You should call your healthcare provider if you experience:Chest pain.Difficulty breathing.Signs of infection, such as redness or yellow discharge at the incision site or a fever.A note from Cleveland ClinicYou may need video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to diagnose or treat lung cancer.
