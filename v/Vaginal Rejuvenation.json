Due to causes ranging from childbirth and aging to genetics, your vagina and its surrounding tissues may lose elasticity and strength. This leads to several issues like incontinence (leaking urine), vaginal dryness, sagging skin and lack of sexual pleasure. Many women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB) look to vaginal rejuvenation to improve these conditions and restore the look and function of their vagina. There are surgical and nonsurgical options for vaginal rejuvenation.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyWhy do people get vaginal rejuvenation?People get vaginal rejuvenation to address common issues associated with having children or menopause, including vaginal looseness, lack of lubrication and loss of sexual intimacy. Treatment can help minimize these symptoms as well as:Loose skin around the vagina.Leaking urine when jumping, sneezing or laughing.Not being able to hold your urine.Decreased libido.Excess dryness.Painful sex.Loss of sensation and sexual satisfaction.Lack of confidence or low self-esteem.What are the different kinds of vaginal rejuvenation?Vaginal rejuvenation procedures can be surgical or nonsurgical. Treatment affects the vulva (the outer part of the female genitals) and the vaginal canal (where penetration occurs during sex or where you put a tampon).Surgical methods of vaginal rejuvenationSurgical methods of vaginal rejuvenation typically involve sedation or anesthesia. A gynecologic or plastic surgeon performs these procedures. Some common surgical procedures for vaginal rejuvenation are:Labiaplasty: Reshaping your labia or the \u201clips\u201d of your vagina.Vaginoplasty: Tightens or repairs the vaginal canal after childbirth.Clitoral hood reduction: Removes extra tissue that covers the clitoris.Monsplasty: Removes fatty tissue from the public bone area.Vulvoplasty: Reshapes the vulvar area (external genitalia).Perineoplasty: Strengthens the perineum (space between your vaginal and anus).Nonsurgical methods of vaginal rejuvenationNonsurgical methods of vaginal rejuvenation are noninvasive with a short recovery time. They help tighten and tone your vaginal area without needles or surgery. Nonsurgical vaginal rejuvenation involves heating the top layers of vaginal tissue. This causes the underlying tissue to create extra collagen and new, firmer tissue.Nonsurgical treatment includes:CO2 laser treatment: The laser heats the upper layers of the tissue in your vagina, causing the tissue in the lower layers to make more collagen. This makes the skin firmer and tighter. Brand names of laser devices include MonaLisa Touch\u00ae, FemTouch\u00ae and FemiLift\u00ae.RF (radio frequency) treatment: RF treatment uses electromagnetic waves, similar to the waves used in a microwave (but to a lesser extent). RF waves heat the vaginal tissue, encouraging blood flow and collagen production. Brand names of RF devices include Viveve\u00ae, Emsella\u00ae and ThermiVA\u00ae.RF and laser treatments are done in an office setting. Little, if any, local anesthetic is used during the procedure. You can typically continue with your day without needing any recovery time.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow do they do surgical vaginal rejuvenation?It depends on the type of surgery. First, you\u2019ll meet with a surgeon to discuss your symptoms and what you hope to achieve with surgery. Use this time to ask questions and understand the risks and benefits of the procedure.Most vaginal rejuvenation surgeries last one to two hours, but it depends on the procedure, the level of work involved and the method the surgeon uses. In most cases, surgical vaginal rejuvenation is done under general anesthesia in an outpatient facility. Once you\u2019re asleep, the surgeon makes incisions (cuts) on your vulva or in your vagina and the surrounding tissues and muscles. The location of the incisions varies depending on the type of surgery. Finally, they close the incisions with dissolvable stitches.Your surgeon will give you post-operative instructions, including a list of restricted activities (like sex). You\u2019ll be allowed to use ice packs and pain relievers for discomfort. Since you\u2019re asleep, you won\u2019t experience pain during the surgery.Before consenting to surgical procedures, make sure you understand the treatment method and risks. As with any surgery, there are post-operative instructions you need to follow to prevent infection and injury.How do they do laser vaginal rejuvenation?With this type of vaginal rejuvenation, tightening and toning occur when a probe (or wand) is inserted into your vagina or guided across your external genitals. The probe has a light-like top, which heats the tissue. Your surgeon or provider rotates the wand or uses gentle strokes to distribute the heat in the affected areas.Laser (or RF) vaginal rejuvenation treatment lasts anywhere from five to 30 minutes, depending on the type and intensity of the laser or RF waves and the procedure you\u2019re having.Nonsurgical vaginal rejuvenation is painless and requires no anesthesia. Your provider may use a topical anesthetic if discomfort occurs. The treatment area may feel warm or like a bee sting during the procedure. You\u2019ll need to refrain from sex or using tampons for three to five days. Follow all of your provider\u2019s post-procedure instructions for the best results.You may experience some redness or swelling after treatment, but this should subside within 24 -48 hours. You may need several treatments before you reach your desired outcome.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind Your Ob/GynMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of vaginal rejuvenation?Vaginal rejuvenation can:Improve the tightness of your vagina.Help with incontinence (leaking urine).Increase lubrication and moisture.Increase vaginal sensitivity and sensations.Strengthen weak vaginal and pelvic muscles.Improve painful intercourse.Enhance the appearance of your vulvar area (labia, clitoris or vaginal opening).Are there any complications associated with vaginal rejuvenation?Not all vaginal rejuvenation treatment has been proven safe or effective.
