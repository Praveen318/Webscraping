Another name for the opening of the urethra is the meatus (me-ate-us). The meatus is typically at the end of your penis.In a baby with hypospadias, their meatus forms in a different location. It may form:Near the head of their penis (subcoronal).Along their penis shaft (midshaft).Where their penis and scrotum meet (penoscrotal). The scrotum is the pouch of skin behind their penis that typically contains their testes.If your child has hypospadias, they may also have congenital penile curvature (chordee) and penoscrotal transposition (a condition in which their scrotum forms above their penis). Your child\u2019s healthcare provider may need to correct these conditions as well.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs to have hypospadias repair?If your child has hypospadias, their healthcare provider typically recommends a hypospadias repair between six months to two years after birth. However, as their parent, it\u2019s your decision whether your child will have the repair or not.Is hypospadias repair necessary?A hypospadias repair isn\u2019t always necessary. One of the main objectives of hypospadias repair is to make urinating (peeing) and achieving orgasm (ejaculating) easier and more comfortable.If your child has minor hypospadias, they may not need a hypospadias repair.Is hypospadias repair a major surgery?Yes, a hypospadias repair is major surgery. However, some cases of hypospadias are more complicated. Your child may require several more extensive procedures.How common are hypospadias repairs?Hypospadias repairs are very common.Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital conditions in children with penises. Approximately 1 of every 250 to 300 newborn babies has hypospadias.Milder forms of hypospadias (subcoronal) are more common than severe forms (penoscrotal).AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a hypospadias repair?Before a hypospadias repair, you\u2019ll meet with your child\u2019s healthcare provider. They\u2019ll evaluate your child\u2019s general health and take vitals (temperature, pulse and blood pressure).They\u2019ll also perform a physical examination of your child\u2019s penis. They\u2019ll:Locate the opening in their penis.Ask questions, including how strong their pee flow is, in which direction their pee flows and if there is any spraying or leaking.Determine how much curving there is when your child\u2019s penis is erect.Perform a cystoscopy or urethrogram, if necessary. A cystoscopy or urethrogram allows your child\u2019s healthcare provider to find any blockages.Tell your child\u2019s healthcare provider about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications your child takes, including herbal supplements. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your child\u2019s risk of bleeding.Tell your child\u2019s provider about any allergies your child has as well. Include all known allergies, including to medications, skin cleaners like iodine or isopropyl alcohol, latex and foods.In severe cases, your child\u2019s healthcare provider may recommend giving your child testosterone injections. Testosterone injections help safely increase the length and width of your child\u2019s penis. A larger penis helps improve the odds of a successful surgery.Your healthcare provider will also give you specific directions on when to give your child food or drinks before the procedure. These directions vary based on your child\u2019s age. It\u2019s important to follow these directions. If your child has fluids or food in their stomach, there\u2019s a chance they could vomit (throw up) while under anesthesia. If they throw up, they may inhale food or fluid into their lungs (pulmonary aspiration). Pulmonary aspiration may cause pneumonia and asphyxiation.Your child\u2019s healthcare provider will also explain the procedure to you. They may give you tips on keeping calm before the surgery, which helps your child relax. Tips may include paying attention to your body language, facial expressions and tone of voice. Your child may not have the ability or vocabulary to understand what\u2019s happening. Still, they can pick up on your non-verbal cues. The calmer you are, the more relaxed your child will be.What happens during hypospadias repair?A special team of healthcare providers specializing in children (pediatrics) will perform a hypospadias repair. The team includes:Pediatric urologist.Pediatric anesthesiologist.Pediatric nurse.Your child\u2019s pediatric anesthesiologist will sedate your child (put them under) with general anesthesia. They won\u2019t be awake, won\u2019t move and won\u2019t feel any pain during the procedure.Once your child is asleep, the pediatric urologist uses a sharp, sterile knife (scalpel) to remove a section of your child\u2019s foreskin (a piece of skin that covers the head of their penis). They\u2019ll then use the foreskin to form a tube and attach it to your child\u2019s urethra to make it longer. A longer urethra allows them to move the meatus to the tip of your child\u2019s penis.Commonly, the pediatric urologist inserts a catheter (stent) into your child\u2019s urethra. A catheter is a soft, hollow tube, usually made out of rubber, silicone or another medical-grade material. A catheter helps your child\u2019s urethra maintain its shape as it heals. It also drains pee. The catheter may remain in place for up to two weeks after the hypospadias repair.Your child\u2019s pediatric urologist may also make other repairs. Other procedures may include:Urethroplasty. A urethroplasty rebuilds the urethra, so pee and semen flow as far forward as possible.Meatoplasty (glanuloplasty). During a meatoplasty, a urologist creates a new opening to their urethra and reconstructs the head (glans) of their penis to accommodate the new opening.Scrotoplasty. A scrotoplasty repairs the scrotum.Finally, the pediatric urologist uses dissolvable stitches to close the incisions (cuts). The stitches should dissolve within two weeks.What are the stages of hypospadias repair?A hypospadias repair may be a one- or two-stage procedure based on severity.If your child has mild hypospadias, they usually require only a one-stage hypospadias repair. A one-stage hypospadias repair is only one surgery.If your child has penoscrotal hypospadias, they require a two-stage hypospadias repair. A two-stage procedure is two surgeries that are usually spaced six months apart. During this procedure, the urologist may use skin from your child\u2019s mouth to help create their new urethra.How long does a hypospadias repair take?A hypospadias repair may take up to two to three hours.AdvertisementWhat happens after hypospadias repair?After a hypospadias repair, a healthcare provider covers your child\u2019s stitches with bandages and secure the stent.The pediatric anesthesiologist stops putting anesthesia into your child\u2019s body to keep them asleep.Your child moves to a recovery room, where providers wait for them to wake up and monitor their overall health. Most hypospadias repair procedures are outpatient procedures, so your child can go home the same day they have surgery.Healthcare providers will give you instructions on how to help your child recover, especially for the first week after surgery. They may prescribe your child medication to relieve pain.Once your child\u2019s healthcare providers determine they\u2019re healthy and no longer require monitoring, they\u2019ll let you take your child home.Risks / BenefitsHow successful is hypospadias surgery in babies?A hypospadias repair has a high rate of success.
