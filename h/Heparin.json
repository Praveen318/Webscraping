People often receive heparin through an IV during a hospital stay, but you can also inject it into your skin. People take heparin for different lengths of time, depending on why they need it. Heparin works quickly but also wears off quickly.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is heparin?Heparin is an anticoagulant (\u201cblood thinner\u201d) that stops your blood from forming blood clots or making them bigger. It can help a blood clot dissolve faster, but it can\u2019t break it down.Your digestive system can\u2019t absorb heparin, so you need to receive it a different way. A heparin infusion goes into your body through an IV in your vein. You can also inject it below your skin.How does heparin work?Heparin makes your blood less able to clot. To do this, it makes thrombin inactive. Thrombin has a major role in the clot-making process. Heparin also blocks factor Xa, another clotting factor in your blood, preventing it from playing its part in making clots. Imagine if your body used an assembly line to make clots; heparin would be taking tools away from two workers with important jobs on the line.What is heparin used for?Healthcare providers use heparin to treat or prevent blood clots that can cause you harm. You may receive heparin if you have:Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a blood clot in your vein.Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in a deep vein in your leg or arm.Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blood clot that breaks loose from the wall of your vein and travels to your lungs.Heart attack.Stroke, a blood clot in your brain.A blood clot or blockage in one of the arteries in your arms or legs.A procedure, surgery or injury that keeps you from being able to move around, such as a joint replacement operation.Atrial fibrillation (Afib), a type of abnormal heart rhythm.Heart surgery.An angioplasty procedure or stent placement in your heart\u2019s arteries.Dialysis for failing kidneys.You may be on heparin temporarily while you\u2019re in the hospital if you have a mechanical heart valve or an acquired or genetic condition that makes you prone to forming blood clots.Sometimes, pregnant people may need heparin if there\u2019s a concern about losing the fetus. (Heparin doesn\u2019t go through the placenta to a fetus.)AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens when you receive heparin?When a healthcare provider gives you heparin as an infusion through an IV line, they have to draw and test your blood first. Your test results tell them the correct amount of heparin to give you.An activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test tells how long it takes for your blood to clot. If you already have heparin in your body, your provider will check to see how well it\u2019s working. They\u2019ll adjust your heparin dose and test regularly to ensure the heparin is working correctly.When they need fast results, providers use an activated clotting time (ACT) test.You may receive infusion therapy in a hospital or even at home. Your provider will give you the information you need if you\u2019re having infusion therapy at home.How long will I need heparin?The amount of time that you need heparin depends on why you\u2019re taking it. For example, after surgery, you may need heparin for seven days or until you can prevent blood clots by walking around.Healthcare providers use heparin in a hospital setting. Before you leave the hospital, they\u2019ll switch you over to a different medicine that doesn\u2019t need an IV or injection. When you go home from the hospital, you\u2019ll probably be taking a type of blood thinner that you can swallow instead of giving yourself injections.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of heparin?Heparin\u2019s benefits include:Working quickly.Wearing off quickly.Being reversible with a heparin antidote called protamine.Having a multidecade history of use.AdvertisementWhat are the risks or complications of heparin?If you get hurt when you have heparin in your body, you may bleed too much.
