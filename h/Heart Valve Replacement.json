Heart valve replacement can improve symptoms and quality of life. Biological and mechanical valves are available as well as different surgical approaches. Success rates are high, and people can live many years with a replacement heart valve.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is a heart valve replacement?Heart valve replacement is a procedure to replace one of your heart\u2019s valves with a biological or mechanical valve.Sometimes, a valve doesn\u2019t form right when you\u2019re born. Some people may have a valve that gets too narrow, stiff or leaky. In these cases, your blood can\u2019t move through your heart efficiently.You have four valves that control where your blood goes in your heart. Normally, your heart\u2019s valves are all opening and closing completely when your heart beats. This allows blood to move in an organized way.Your blood moves:From one part of your heart to the next.To your lungs to get oxygen.To your aorta, which sends your oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of your body.Like a sink drain that doesn\u2019t hold all the water or completely drain it, a diseased valve keeps some of your blood from going where it\u2019s supposed to go.If one of your valves isn\u2019t working right, you may need to take medicine or have your valve repaired. If these treatments don\u2019t work, you may need a heart valve replacement.Types of Heart ValvesBiological ValvesBiological valves (also called tissue or bioprosthetic valves) are made of:Cow tissue (bovine).Pig tissue (porcine).Human tissue (allografts or homografts).In general, there\u2019s no difference in durability between the types of biological valves. Biological valves may have some artificial parts to give the valve support and make it easier to put in place.Homograft ValvesA homograft (or allograft) is:A human heart valve that comes from a donor after they die.Most often used to replace a diseased aortic valve in children or young adults or when an infection destroys an aortic valve in adults.Also used to replace the pulmonary valve during the Ross procedure.Mechanical ValvesMechanical valves are made of metal or carbon and are designed to work just like your own valves. The bileaflet valve is the most common type of mechanical valve. It\u2019s made up of two carbon leaflets mounted in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric.Mechanical valves are:Well-tolerated.Very durable.Designed to last a lifetime.Heart valve replacement: mechanical vs. tissueWhen choosing between a biological valve and a mechanical valve, you may want to consider:The inconvenience and risk of bleeding while taking a blood thinner when you have a mechanical valve.The possibility of needing another biological valve replacement during your lifetime.Your age. (A mechanical valve is best for people younger than 50 for an aortic valve and younger than 65 for a mitral valve.)How active you are.Which heart valve is affected?Biological valvesAdvantages: Most people don\u2019t need to take lifelong blood-thinner medication unless they have other conditions, such as atrial fibrillation. If you\u2019re older than 60 years of age, the bovine pericardial valve will probably last for the rest of your life.Drawbacks: In the past, biological valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, recent studies show these valves often last 15 to 20 years or more without a decline in function.Mechanical valvesAdvantages: Mechanical valves are very durable. They\u2019re designed to last a lifetime.Disadvantages: Because of the artificial material in mechanical valves, people who receive these valves need to take warfarin, a blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medication, for the rest of their lives. Blood thinners are medications that delay your blood\u2019s clotting action. They help prevent clots from forming on your new valve. Clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. If you take warfarin, you\u2019ll need to have regular blood tests to see how well you\u2019re responding to the medication and if you need a different dose. Also, some people who have a mechanical valve replacement hear the valve make a clicking noise at times. This is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing.Types of Heart Valve Replacement SurgeryIn addition to the biological or mechanical valve choices, there are options in the method your surgeon uses. They can do open-heart surgery, minimally invasive surgery or go through a blood vessel.Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a treatment option for some people with severe aortic stenosis (narrowing). You may have TAVR if you\u2019re high-risk, although a provider can use it for someone of any risk level.Younger people, those with a bicuspid valve or those who need other procedures like a maze procedure or coronary bypass are more likely to have open-heart surgery.In TAVR, your healthcare provider uses a catheter to replace your diseased valve with a biological valve. They insert the catheter into an artery in your groin or a cut (incision) in your chest. They put the new valve inside of the old one. Your provider can also use this method to replace your pulmonary valve.Ross ProcedureThe Ross procedure involves switching your pulmonary valve to the aortic valve position and then placing a pulmonary homograft. This is a very complex procedure. However, it has many benefits, especially for young people with aortic valve disease.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhen is a heart valve replacement necessary?A heart valve replacement is necessary when valve repair surgery isn\u2019t a treatment option. Valve replacement surgery is most often used to treat people with aortic valve disease, particularly aortic stenosis (narrowing).Other conditions that may require a heart valve replacement include:Mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid valve stenosis (narrowing).Mitral valve prolapse.Aortic, mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (some blood goes the wrong way because of a leaky valve).Congenital (since birth) heart valve disease.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before heart valve replacement?Your healthcare provider may take a chest X-ray and do an electrocardiogram (EKG) a day before your operation.Avoid eating or drinking anything during the night before or the day of your surgery.Follow your provider\u2019s instructions about which medications to take or stop taking before your operation.Take comfortable clothes with you to the hospital, along with shoes you can slip into instead of tie.

For a transcatheter procedure, they\u2019ll place your new valve inside your original one.They\u2019ll close your incisions and start your heart again.What happens after heart valve replacement?You\u2019ll start your hospital stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) so your healthcare provider can keep a close eye on you. Next, you\u2019ll move to a regular room. Your hospital stay may last five to seven days.You can expect to have machines checking your blood pressure and heart rate.There could be tubes draining fluid from your chest.You can drink, eat and walk as soon as you\u2019re able to after your operation.
