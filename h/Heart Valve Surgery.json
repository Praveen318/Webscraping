Valves need to work efficiently to help blood flow the right direction through your heart. Heart valve surgery options include open, minimally invasive or through vein access to your heart. It takes one or two months to recover, depending on the surgery.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewValve Surgery \u2013 Incision Options (Dr. Eric Roselli)Heart valve surgery fixes or replaces one or more of the four valves in your heart. Your valves, located between your heart\u2019s four chambers, keep your blood moving the right way. When valves are working right, your blood should flow through your heart in one direction each time your heart beats.Valves act like doors that open and close with each heartbeat, letting blood flow in and out of the chambers. When a valve isn\u2019t working right, some of the blood may go back to the chamber or room it just left. Other times a valve may become narrow, which may prevent blood from moving forward. This is a problem because it keeps your heart from working efficiently.Your four heart valves are:Tricuspid: Lets oxygen-poor blood flow from your right atrium (upper chamber) to your right ventricle (lower chamber).Pulmonary: Lets oxygen-poor blood move from your right ventricle (lower chamber) to your pulmonary artery, which takes blood to your lungs to get oxygen.Mitral: Lets oxygen-rich blood coming back from your lungs move from your left atrium (upper chamber) to your left ventricle (lower chamber).Aortic: Lets oxygen-rich blood move from your left ventricle (lower chamber) to your aorta, which sends blood to your entire body.Types of heart valve surgeryThe two types of heart valve surgery options are:Valve repair surgery to fix the damaged or faulty valve, while preserving much of the person\u2019s own tissue. The mitral valve is the most commonly repaired valve, but repair surgery can treat problems with the aortic and tricuspid valves.Valve replacement surgery to remove the faulty valve and replace it with a biological (pig, cow or human tissue) or mechanical (metal or carbon) valve. All valve replacements are biocompatible, which means your immune system won\u2019t reject your new valve.You\u2019ll have tests so your healthcare provider can find out the location, type and extent of your valve disease. The test results help determine the best type of procedure for you. Other factors your doctor will consider are:Your heart\u2019s structure.Your age.Other medical conditions you have.Your lifestyle.Your cardiac surgeon can combine valve surgery with other heart surgeries. Examples include surgeries that involve more than one valve procedure and combining valve surgery with:Bypass surgery.Aortic aneurysm surgery.Surgery to treat atrial fibrillation.Can a heart valve repair itself?No, a heart valve can\u2019t repair itself. Valve disease doesn\u2019t go away. It gets worse with time. As the disease gets worse, you\u2019ll have more symptoms and your overall health will suffer. These changes often happen slowly, but they can also occur very quickly.Depending on the type and extent of valve disease you have, you may be able to take medication for the short term. Surgery is the only effective long-term solution, and your healthcare provider will help determine when it\u2019s time to pursue that option.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
