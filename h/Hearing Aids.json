Hearing aids are the recommended treatment for a variety of hearing losses, ranging from mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss.A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted device that directly stimulates your auditory nerve (the nerve that connects your ear to your brain). Cochlear implants are typically recommended for people with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, or for those who don\u2019t benefit from a traditional hearing aid.A bone-anchored auditory implant is a surgically implanted device that sends sound as a vibration directly to your best-functioning inner ear.
