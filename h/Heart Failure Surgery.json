Usually, surgery is an option if you have severe heart failure that hasn\u2019t responded to medications and lifestyle changes. There isn\u2019t a cure for heart failure, but surgery can improve your symptoms and help you live the fullest life possible.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is heart failure surgery?Your heart pumps blood to all the tissues and organs in your body. If you have heart failure (also known as congestive heart failure or CHF), your heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet your body\u2019s needs.Lifestyle changes and medications are usually the first option for treating heart failure. These treatments are often very effective, but some people need surgery. Surgery can help improve your heart function and symptoms. It can also help you live a longer, fuller life.When is congestive heart failure surgery needed?Your healthcare provider may recommend heart failure surgery to:Treat underlying conditions that have caused heart failure.Improve the functioning of your heart.Offer lifesaving treatment for advanced heart failure when lifestyle changes and medications haven\u2019t been effective.What are the types of heart failure surgery?There are several different types of surgery for heart failure. They range from minimally invasive procedures to open-heart surgery and heart transplant.Catheter ablationThis is a minimally invasive procedure that healthcare providers can use to treat arrhythmias, which are abnormal heartbeats caused by irregular electrical impulses. Arrhythmias can be both a cause and symptom of heart failure.A catheter ablation procedure uses a thin tube called a catheter inserted into one of your blood vessels. Your provider guides the catheter to your heart and precisely delivers heat or cold to specific areas of your heart. This isolates areas of tissue that are causing the abnormal electrical impulses.Implanted devices for arrhythmiasIf you have an arrhythmia or a history of a life-threatening event caused by an abnormal heart rhythm, you may receive an implanted device. These devices have wires that your provider inserts into your heart through a vein and a controller implanted under your skin. The controller delivers a charge to your heart to help regulate your heart rate.The types of implanted devices include:Implantable cardioverter defibrillator, detects an abnormal heart rhythm and shocks your heart to restore a normal heart rate.Permanent pacemaker, continuously delivers pulses to your heart to keep your heart rhythm steady.Coronary artery bypass graft surgeryIn people with coronary artery disease, the arteries that carry blood to your heart muscle become lined with deposits called plaque. When these deposits build up, they can narrow or completely block your coronary arteries. This interferes with blood flow and reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients traveling to your heart. Over time, this weakens your heart muscle and reduces its ability to pump blood.In coronary artery bypass graft surgery, a surgeon reroutes blood around a narrowed or blocked coronary artery. They\u2019ll use a blood vessel (graft) from somewhere else in your body and attach it above and below the affected area. Surgeons perform this procedure as open-heart surgery or as minimally invasive surgery, depending on your situation.Coronary angioplasty and stentThis is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat coronary artery disease. It opens narrowed or blocked coronary arteries from the inside.In a coronary angioplasty and stent procedure, your provider:Inserts the catheter into a blood vessel in your groin or wrist.Threads the catheter to the narrowed or blocked artery in your heart.Inflates a balloon to compress the plaque inside the artery and open the blockage.Installs a metal mesh tube (stent) to hold the artery open.Heart valve surgeryThe valves in your heart separate the upper and lower chambers and keep blood moving in the forward direction. In heart valve disease, your heart valves may leak (regurgitation), allowing blood to flow backward. Valves can also become stiff and narrow (stenosis). In both cases, your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This added stress on the pumping chambers of your heart can lead to heart failure.Heart valve surgery may involve the repair or replacement of a valve. There are many types of heart valve surgeries. Providers perform some heart valve procedures using catheters, which require only a small incision in your groin. Other heart valve procedures require open-heart surgery or minimally invasive surgery through a smaller incision in your chest.Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)Some people with heart failure reach a point where their heart can no longer meet the needs of their body on its own. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is an implanted device that helps your left ventricle pump blood. It connects to an external controller worn on the outside of your body.You may receive an LVAD as a long-term treatment for heart failure or as a bridge treatment while you wait for a heart transplant.Heart transplantHeart transplant surgery replaces your heart with one from a donor. It\u2019s the last option for people with end-stage heart failure. Due to a shortage of donor hearts, there are strict criteria you must meet to qualify for a heart transplant.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

In these procedures, your provider accesses your heart using a small incision in your groin. Catheter-based procedures are usually quicker and may take an hour or two.AdvertisementWhat happens after heart failure surgery?After surgery, you may go to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit (ICU) to recover or directly to a hospital room.
