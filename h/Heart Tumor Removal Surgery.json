It\u2019s especially helpful for people who have benign heart tumors that pose a risk of complications.Depending on the type of tumor you have, you may need reconstructive surgery to repair damage to your heart or one of its valves. Your healthcare provider will tell you if this is something you need.What is a heart tumor?A heart tumor is a growth that forms in your heart. Primary heart tumors begin in your heart, as opposed to spreading from somewhere else in your body. Most primary heart tumors are benign (not cancerous). They have essentially no risk of metastasis (spreading), and they\u2019re not associated with decreased life expectancy as long as they\u2019re removed.The vast majority of primary heart tumors are myxomas or papillary fibroelastomas. These are benign growths that can impact heart valve function. More commonly, they can increase your risk for a blood clot that travels through your bloodstream (embolism) or a stroke. So, your healthcare provider may recommend surgery to remove the tumor.Cancerous heart tumors (sarcomas) are extremely rare, and most often they\u2019re not treated with surgery.Can you remove a tumor from the heart?Yes, in many cases, surgeons can completely remove a tumor from your heart. Surgeries to remove benign tumors like myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas are very successful.However, some complex benign tumors and cancerous tumors can be harder to remove. In those cases, surgeons may remove as much of the tumor as possible (partial resection). This should help ease some of your symptoms and give you a better quality of life. In other cases, surgery may not be feasible, and your provider may recommend other treatments or palliative care.Who needs to have this surgery?You may need surgery to remove a heart tumor if your healthcare provider believes the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks. Your provider may recommend surgery if the tumor:Causes symptoms.Interferes with your heart function.Raises your risk of complications like blood clots or a stroke.Is growing quickly.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow do surgeons remove a tumor from the heart?Open-heart surgery is the traditional method for removing heart tumors. However, medical advances have led to minimally invasive methods that give you an easier recovery.Heart tumors are rare, and surgeries to remove them aren\u2019t as common as most other heart surgeries. So, it\u2019s important to seek care at a major medical center that has experience in treating heart tumors. A surgical team will assess your situation and decide the most suitable type of surgery for you.Open-heart surgery to remove tumorOpen-heart surgery gives your surgeon a direct view of your heart and surrounding anatomy. It requires a median sternotomy, which is a procedure that makes a long, vertical incision down the middle of your chest.Your surgical team gives you anesthesia so you\u2019re in a deep sleep during the surgery. They also connect you to cardiopulmonary bypass (a heart-lung machine). This machine does the work of your heart and lungs and allows your surgeon to operate on a still (non-beating) heart.Your surgeon removes the tumor and, if needed, reconstructs damaged parts of your heart. Reconstruction may include valve repair or replacement depending on how the tumor affected your heart.Minimally invasive heart surgeryMinimally invasive heart surgery doesn\u2019t require an incision down the middle of your chest, like in open-heart surgery. Instead, your surgeon uses small incisions to access your heart and remove the tumor. You still need anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass.Robotically assisted heart surgeryRobotically assisted removal of heart tumors is a type of minimally invasive heart surgery. Surgeons perform it using an endoscopic, closed chest approach.For this procedure, your surgeon creates several small incisions between your ribs. These incisions allow your surgeon to insert tools connected to robotic arms. Your surgeon\u2019s hands control the movements of these robotic arms. Imaging technology allows your surgeon to see inside your heart throughout the process.What happens before surgery?Your surgical team will tell you how to prepare for your surgery. Be sure to closely follow their instructions on:Any needed changes to your medication schedule.When you should start fasting (not eating or drinking) the night before your surgery.When to quit smoking or using tobacco products in the weeks leading up to your surgery. This is important for lowering your risk of complications.Your surgical team will also run one or more tests to get a clear look at the tumor and your heart. Tests you may need include:Computed tomography (CT) scan.Coronary angiogram.Echocardiogram.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.AdvertisementWhat happens during surgery?The details of your surgery depend on the method (open-heart vs. minimally invasive). In general, your surgeon will:Give you anesthesia and connect you to a cardio-pulmonary bypass machine.Make one or more incisions in your chest to access your heart.Use various tools to carefully remove the tumor from your heart and reconstruct surrounding tissues, if needed.Close the incision or incisions with stitches.Your surgical team will give you more information to help you understand what your surgery involves and how long it\u2019ll take.What happens after surgery?After your surgery, you\u2019ll spend one or more days in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. After that, you\u2019ll continue recovering in a regular hospital room. Your length of stay in the hospital depends on the surgical method and how your recovery goes. Each person is different. Your surgical team will tell you how things are going and when you can expect to return home.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of heart tumor removal surgery?Heart tumor removal surgery can ease your symptoms, reduce the risk of complications and help you to enjoy a better quality of life.Benefits of robotically assisted surgeryCompared with traditional open-heart surgery, robotically assisted surgery offers you the following benefits:Smaller incisions with minimal scarring.Less trauma, including less pain.Shorter hospital stay (usually three to four days).Less use of pain medications.Less bleeding.Lower risk of infection.Shorter recovery and quicker return to your normal activities.What are the risks of heart tumor removal surgery?Possible complications include:Allergic reaction to anesthesia.Arrhythmia.Bleeding.Confusion or trouble thinking clearly (temporary cognitive changes can occur after heart surgery, but researchers aren\u2019t sure exactly why).Damage to blood vessels or organs.Infection (mediastinitis).Stroke.Minimally invasive methods lower your risk of complications.
