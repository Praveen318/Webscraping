It\u2019s usually performed to correct a malformation of the hymen that\u2019s present at birth. The hymen is a piece of tissue near the opening of your vagina. Your hymen is flexible, thin and stretches over time. Most people\u2019s hymens will naturally open before puberty to allow for menstruation to occur. However, some people are born with a hymen that has formed irregularly. The size, shape or thickness can prevent them from having normal menstruation, inserting a tampon or having sexual intercourse. A hymenectomy corrects these irregularities.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

Conditions of the hymen can affect menstruation, sexual intercourse and can cause pain. Your healthcare provider may recommend a hymenectomy to treat these congenital hymenal conditions:Cribriform hymen: A condition where your hymen contains many small holes.Imperforate hymen: When your hymen completely covers the opening to your vagina.Microperforate hymen: When your hymen covers your entire vaginal opening except for a tiny hole.Septate hymen: Your hymen has an extra piece of tissue, giving it the appearance of two hymens.Some hymen abnormalities are discovered at birth, while others aren\u2019t diagnosed until puberty when a young person has issues with menstruation or inserting a tampon. When you can\u2019t menstruate, it can cause blood to back up into your uterus, fallopian tubes and abdomen. In rare cases, blood building up in your abdomen is life-threatening. Other times a hymenectomy is performed later in life when a person is experiencing pain during sex.What does a hymenectomy treat?A hymenectomy treats conditions of the hymen that can interfere with regular menstruation. These congenital disorders can make it hard for period blood to flow out the vagina because the hymen is blocking its exit. A hymenectomy opens or removes your hymen to allow for normal menstruation and the use of tampons. In some cases, a hymenectomy allows you to have pain-free sexual intercourse.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a hymenectomy?Your healthcare provider will examine your hymen to diagnose the irregularity and determine treatment.
