A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac surrounding your testicle. It causes swelling in your scrotum, which is the pouch that holds your testes (testicles). You may need a bilateral hydrocelectomy if you have hydroceles around both of your testicles. \u201cBilateral\u201d means that the condition affects your left testicle and right testicle.Hydroceles can be scary because you can see them and they\u2019re in a sensitive part of your body. They\u2019re usually painless and sometimes improve without treatment. However, you should discuss any abnormality in your scrotum with your healthcare provider right away. It could be a sign of a more serious problem.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your risk of bleeding.In adults or teenagers who have gone through puberty, your healthcare provider may ask you to shave away the hair from your entire scrotum or groin area the night before or the morning of your procedure.
