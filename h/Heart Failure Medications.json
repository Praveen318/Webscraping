Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, is a long-term condition. It affects nearly 6 million people in the U.S.If you have heart failure, your heart can\u2019t pump blood as well as it should. Over time, this leads to fluid buildup (congestion) in different parts of your body, including your legs, feet and lungs. You may also feel other symptoms including shortness of breath and fatigue.Heart failure is progressive, meaning it gets worse over time. Treatment is essential to lower your risk of serious complications, like organ damage and sudden cardiac arrest. Treatment involves both lifestyle changes and medications. Some people need surgery.Medications can\u2019t cure heart failure. But they can slow down its progression and improve your quality of life. People with heart failure usually need to take several different medications. That\u2019s because each drug does a different job within your body to manage heart failure and its symptoms.Your healthcare provider will decide the best medications for you based on your symptoms, your other medical issues (like diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease) and how far your condition has progressed. Your provider may change your treatment plan as you go along. For example, they may adjust your dose or change medications. Many of these medicines lower your blood pressure, so your provider will work with you to find a combination that works for you and keeps your blood pressure normal.Your provider may also prescribe other medications to manage other circulatory system problems.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
