Your surgeon will make a few small incisions (cuts) in the skin of your hip then insert a special tool called an arthroscope into your hip joint. The arthroscope includes a camera and a light that lets your surgeon identify and repair damage inside your hip. They\u2019ll also insert any other small tools they need to repair damage to your bones or connective tissues.The incisions required to perform a hip arthroscopy are much smaller than other forms of surgery, which means it\u2019s less stressful on your body than other procedures. You\u2019ll need physical therapy after your surgery to increase your strength and ability to move your hip again. Most people need a few months to recover after a hip arthroscopy.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyWho needs hip arthroscopy?Anyone with hip pain that hasn\u2019t responded to other treatments is a good candidate for hip arthroscopy. It can also help people who are having trouble moving properly because of an issue inside their hip joint. Typically, your healthcare provider will recommend arthroscopy only after they\u2019ve identified the cause of your pain and non-surgical treatments like steroid injections or physical therapy and they haven\u2019t completely worked.Hip arthroscopy vs. total hip replacementHip arthroscopy is a much less invasive procedure than a total hip replacement (hip arthroplasty). For many people, an arthroscopy will solve the issues causing pain or mobility issues in their hips. If arthroscopy isn\u2019t successful \u2014 or if your symptoms are severe enough \u2014 your provider might recommend a hip replacement. People with significant damage to their cartilage or severe arthritis usually need total hip replacements.What does hip arthroscopy treat?Hip arthroscopy is an effective, minimally invasive surgery that can treat a wide range of issues.Some of the most common conditions hip arthroscopy is used to treat include:Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI): FAI \u2014 also called hip impingement \u2014 is an unusually shaped hip joint that causes two bones in your hip to rub together. The pressure causes friction between the top of your femur (thighbone) and acetabulum (hip socket). FAI can limit your range of motion and cause pain.Labral tears: Labral tears are injuries to the labrum, the soft tissue that covers the acetabulum (socket) of your hip. A labral tear can be caused by trauma, structural problems or degenerative issues.Removing pieces of bone or cartilage: If your hip\u2019s bones or cartilage are damaged, or loose pieces inside your joint are causing you pain, your surgeon can remove them.Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition that means your femur does not fit together with the pelvis as it should.Tendon tears: Tendons link your muscles to your bones. Your surgeon can reattach tendons that have torn away from the bones in your hip during an injury.Tendon releases: Contractures (tendons that are too tight) can be released or moved with hip arthroscopy.AdvertisementHow common is hip arthroscopy?Hip arthroscopy is becoming increasingly common, and surgeons are able to treat more conditions than they were even five or 10 years ago.For years, arthroscopy has been used to treat issues in people\u2019s shoulders, knees and ankles, and it\u2019s quickly becoming more common to address hip issues. Ongoing advancements in technology and surgical techniques have made hip arthroscopy an option for more people than ever before. In fact, some experts estimate that the number of hip arthroscopies performed in the U.S. increased more than 600% in the last 15 years.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before hip arthroscopy?Before your hip arthroscopy, you might need to:Stop taking certain medications: Make sure you tell your provider and surgeon everything you\u2019re taking \u2014 including over-the-counter medicines or herbal supplements. This is especially important if you take any drugs to prevent blood clots. Your surgeon will tell you which medications to stop or how to alter your daily routine.Stop smoking: If you smoke or use other kinds of tobacco products, you should try to quit. In addition to the everyday health risks, smoking makes it harder for your body to heal after a surgery.Reduce how much alcohol you drink: Alcohol thins your blood, which can make it dangerous to have in your system before and after surgery.Fast: Your surgeon will tell you if you need to avoid eating and drinking anything before your hip arthroscopy. You might need to plan ahead and not eat or drink anything except water up to 12 hours before surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens during hip arthroscopy?During a hip arthroscopy your surgeon will make a few small cuts (about the size of a buttonhole) in the skin on your hip and insert the arthroscope. They\u2019ll also insert any other tools they need to repair any damage to your hip\u2019s bones or connective tissues.You will receive either regional anesthesia near your hip to make sure you don\u2019t feel pain during the surgery or general anesthesia to put you to sleep during the operation.Most arthroscopies take around 90 minutes, but the length of your surgery will depend on your unique needs.What happens after hip arthroscopy?Hip arthroscopy is usually an outpatient surgery, meaning you should be able to go home the same day as your procedure. Most people need to wear a brace on their hip for around three weeks after surgery. You\u2019ll need to use crutches for a few weeks, and won\u2019t be able to put any weight on your hip for at least a week.Your provider or surgeon will give you a personalized recovery plan and will go over the results of your surgery with you.You may need to:Avoid putting weight or pressure on your hip (including while you sleep).Ice and elevate the area.Keep the incision clean and covered.Take NSAIDs for pain after the surgery.Take showers, not baths, until the incision heals.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule Hip SurgeryFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of hip arthroscopy?Hip arthroscopy is much less invasive than other types of surgery.
