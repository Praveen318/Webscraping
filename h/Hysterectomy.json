Robotic arms and instruments are controlled by the surgeon.The recovery is similar to a laparoscopic hysterectomy.Abdominal hysterectomyYour uterus is removed through a six- to eight-inch-long incision in your abdomen.The incision is made either from your belly button to your pubic bone or across the top of your public hairline. The surgeon will use stitches or staples to close the incision.Most commonly used when cancer is involved, when the uterus is enlarged or when disease spreads to other pelvic areas.It generally requires a longer hospital stay (two or three days) and a longer recovery time.How long does a hysterectomy procedure last?The procedure lasts one to three hours. The time can vary depending on the size of your uterus and the need to take down scarring from previous surgeries, as well as if other tissue, such as endometrial tissue, and other organs are being removed with your uterus (like your fallopian tubes or ovaries).What are the most common side effects of a hysterectomy?Some of the most common side effects of a hysterectomy are vaginal drainage (which may occur up to six weeks after surgery) and irritation at the incision sites.If your ovaries were removed at the time of your hysterectomy, you may experience menopausal symptoms such as:Hot flashes.Vaginal dryness.Loss of libido.Difficulty sleeping (insomnia).Your doctor will discuss treatment options to avoid the side effects of menopause mentioned above.What happens after a hysterectomy?The amount of time you spend in the hospital following a hysterectomy varies depending on what kind of surgery you had.

Wash the incision with soap and water (the stitches don\u2019t have to be removed, as they\u2019ll dissolve in about six weeks). A bandage over the incision isn\u2019t necessary. If surgical strips were used, they should fall off on their own within a week. If staples were used, they\u2019ll need to be removed by your healthcare provider.You can drive about two weeks after abdominal surgery or when you\u2019re no longer taking narcotics for pain.

It\u2019s normal to have scarring, both internally and externally. Laparoscopic surgeries will cause smaller, less visible scars as opposed to abdominal hysterectomies.If your ovaries remain, you shouldn\u2019t experience hormone-related effects. If your ovaries were removed with your uterus before menopause, you may experience the symptoms that often occur with menopause, such as hot flashes. Your healthcare provider may prescribe hormone replacement therapy to relieve menopausal symptoms.People who undergo a subtotal hysterectomy may continue to have a light period for a year after the procedure. This happens because small amounts of the endometrial lining can remain in your cervix, causing light periods.EmotionallyEmotional reactions to a hysterectomy vary and can depend on how well you were prepared for the surgery, the reason for having it and whether the problem has been treated.Some may feel a sense of loss, but these emotional reactions are usually temporary.

Using a water-based lubricant can help with dryness.Can you still orgasm after a hysterectomy?Yes, you can still have an orgasm and ejaculate after a hysterectomy.
