PolicyWhen will I need to use crutches?It\u2019s very common to need crutches after an injury or surgery. Some of the most common include:Sports injuries: All kinds of injuries from sprains, to ACL tears or a torn meniscus can require you to use crutches while you recover.Bone fractures: You might need crutches after breaking a bone in your leg, knee, ankle or foot.Ligament or tendon injuries: Your healthcare provider might prescribe crutches if you experience an injury like an Achilles tendon rupture or tendinitis.Surgery: You might need crutches after surgery on your lower body, including common procedures like arthroscopic surgery.How much weight can I bear with crutches?How much weight or pressure you can put on your leg, knee, ankle or foot depends on why you need crutches and how far into your recovery you are. Your healthcare provider, surgeon or physical therapist will advise how much weight you can lean on your recovering side \u2014 the medical term is \u201cweight bearing.\u201d Some of the terms they might use include:Nonweight bearing: You can\u2019t put any weight on the part of your body that\u2019s recovering.Toe touch for balance only: Only put your toe on the ground to lightly stabilize yourself and regain your balance. Don\u2019t apply any weight or pressure on it.Partial weight baring or a certain percentage: Your healthcare provider will say you can use a certain percentage of your weight \u2014 like 50% or 80%. This isn\u2019t usually a literal amount that you can\u2019t go above \u2014 it\u2019s more like a guide to help you understand how much you can use your recovering leg. Picture putting that amount of your usual weight down as you stand, walk and move.Weight bearing as tolerated: This means you can use your full weight as often as you can without feeling pain or other symptoms. Don\u2019t push beyond your limits unless your healthcare provider tells you it\u2019s OK.What are the different types of crutches?There are a few types of crutches you might need:Underarm (axillary) crutches: Underarm crutches are the most common type of crutch. They have a padded top that fits under your arm below your armpit, a straight frame and a handgrip.Forearm crutches: You might see these crutches referred to as elbow crutches. They\u2019re usually shorter than underarm crutches. Forearm crutches have a supportive cuff that fits around the back of your upper arm just above your elbow and a handgrip.Gutter crutches: Gutter crutches are less common than the other types. They have a padded pocket on top of a straight pole. You rest your forearms in the pocket and hold onto the attached handgrip at the front of the gutter.AdvertisementHow do I make crutches more comfortable?Adjusting your crutches will make them more comfortable:Most crutches can be adjusted using a sliding mechanism. Ask your healthcare provider or physical therapist for help fitting the length to your body before using them.Make sure your crutches are adjusted to your height. If you have underarm crutches, the top should hit a few inches below your armpits, and the handgrips should be around your hips.Always rest your weight on your arms using the handgrips. Don\u2019t lean on the top of the crutches under your arms.Remember these safety tips:Make sure your crutches have grooved rubber tips covering the bottom and that the underarm support and handgrips have comfortable padding.Check the bottom of your crutches for debris like stones, leaves or anything else that could make you slip after you use them outside.Make sure your home and workspace are free from clutter that could trip you or others.Use your crutches as long as your healthcare provider tells you to. Even if you feel like you\u2019re recovering quickly, if you stop using them too soon, you can reinjure your leg or damage your surgery site.How do I stand with crutches?Follow these tips for standing up with crutches:Stand up straight with the crutches placed slightly in front of your body and slightly apart on either side.Don\u2019t lean your weight on the underarm supports.
