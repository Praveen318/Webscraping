Blocked fallopian tubes may make it difficult to become pregnant.What is operative hysteroscopy?Operative hysteroscopy treats an abnormality detected during a diagnostic hysteroscopy. Your provider may perform a diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy at the same time, avoiding the need for a second surgery.

Surgical removal of a polyp is called a hysteroscopy polypectomy. Surgical removal of a fibroid is called a hysteroscopy myomectomy.Adhesions: Also known as Asherman\u2019s syndrome, uterine adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form in your uterus and may lead to changes in menstrual flow and cause infertility. Hysteroscopy can help your doctor locate and remove the adhesions.Septums: Hysteroscopy can help determine whether you have a uterine septum, a malformation (defect) of the uterus that\u2019s present from birth.Hysteroscopy may also be used to:Diagnose the cause of repeated miscarriages or fertility problems.Locate an intrauterine device (IUD).Diagnose and remove placental tissue after birth.Who is a candidate for hysteroscopy?Your surgeon will review your medical history and evaluate your current health to determine whether a hysteroscopy is appropriate.

The procedure can take place at any time if you\u2019ve gone through menopause.What happens before a hysteroscopy?Your surgeon will ensure you\u2019re a good candidate for a hysteroscopy, talk you through the procedure and answer any questions you may have.

The light from the hysteroscope makes it easier for your surgeon to get a clear view.Insert surgical instruments through the hysteroscope that can be used to remove any irregular abnormalities (if surgery is needed).A hysteroscopy can last anywhere from five minutes to more than an hour.

It doesn\u2019t usually require a hospital overnight stay. Unlike more invasive procedures that open your abdomen to access organs, a hysteroscopy can be performed through your vagina.Is a D&C the same as a hysteroscopy?No. Both a D&C (dilation and curettage) and an operative hysteroscopy allow your surgeon to remove tissue from your uterus. While a hysteroscopy enables your provider to find growths and remove them with precise surgical instruments, a D&C allows your surgeon to sample greater amounts of tissue from your uterine lining by performing a gentle scraping.Should I be worried about hysteroscopy?You shouldn\u2019t be. Hysteroscopy is widely considered a safe procedure, with minimal risks involved.A note from Cleveland ClinicHysteroscopy allows your provider to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions that may be causing abnormal bleeding.

Ask if additional procedures will occur simultaneously, like a laparoscopy.
