It\u2019s based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it\u2019s specially adapted for people who experience emotions very intensely.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that helps people understand how thoughts affect emotions and behaviors.\u201cDialectical\u201d means combining opposite ideas. DBT focuses on helping people accept the reality of their lives and their behaviors, as well as helping them learn to change their lives, including their unhelpful behaviors.Dialectical behavior therapy was developed in the 1970s by Marsha Linehan, an American psychologist.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) used for?Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is especially effective for people who have difficulty managing and regulating their emotions.DBT has proven to be effective for treating and managing a wide range of mental health conditions, including:Borderline personality disorder (BPD).Self-harm.Suicidal behavior.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Substance use disorder.Eating disorders, specifically binge eating disorder and bulimia.Depression.Anxiety.It\u2019s important to note that the reason DBT has proved effective for treating these conditions is that each of these conditions is thought to be associated with issues that result from unhealthy or problematic efforts to control intense, negative emotions. Rather than depending on efforts that cause problems for the person, DBT helps people learn healthier ways to cope.How do I find a DBT therapist?A therapist can be a psychiatrist (a medical doctor who can prescribe medications), psychiatric nurse, psychologist, social worker or family therapist.Finding the right therapist is often a time-consuming task, and DBT therapy isn\u2019t any different. Try not to become discouraged. Talk to people you trust to give you a referral for a therapist who uses dialectical behavior therapy, whether it\u2019s your primary healthcare provider or a friend or family member.You can also search for therapists online through local and state psychological associations.Be sure that any therapist you\u2019re interested in seeing is a state-certified and licensed mental health professional and that they treat your area of concern (for example, eating disorders, borderline personality disorder, self-harm, etc.).Most therapists\u2019 websites list the conditions and problems they treat. If you have questions, call or email the therapist\u2019s office before you choose.It may be helpful to ask a potential DBT therapist the following questions:What is the nature of your training in DBT?Do you provide comprehensive DBT or a modification? If not comprehensive DBT, why not?Do you belong to a DBT consultation team?What\u2019s your policy on phone calls and emails during the week?How much time will you initially ask me to commit to for the entire therapy process?AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow does dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) work?The main goal of therapists who use dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is to strike a balance between validation (acceptance) of who you are and your challenges and the benefits of change. Your therapist will help you learn new skills to improve emotion regulation.The structure of dialectical behavior therapy can vary some from therapist to therapist, but, in general, DBT involves these four types of sessions:DBT pre-assessment.Individual therapy.Skills training in groups.Telephone crisis coaching.DBT pre-assessmentYour therapist may offer an assessment before starting DBT. They\u2019ll determine how suitable DBT is for you by asking you questions and explaining how DBT works. If you decide that DBT is the right therapy for you, they\u2019ll ask you to commit to the treatment and the length of treatment.Individual DBT therapyIndividual DBT therapy involves weekly sessions with your therapist. Each session lasts about 40 minutes to 60 minutes.Individual DBT therapy sessions have the following goals:To help keep you safe by reducing suicidal and self-harming behaviors, if applicable.To limit behaviors that get in the way of productive therapy.To help you reach your goals and improve your quality of life by addressing what\u2019s blocking your progress, such as mental health conditions or relationship issues.To help you learn new skills to replace unhelpful behaviors.Your therapist will likely ask you to keep a diary to track your emotions and actions and to look for patterns of behavior. You\u2019ll bring this diary with you to your sessions so you and your therapist can decide what to work on for each session.DBT skills training in groupsIn these sessions, your therapist will teach you skills in a group setting. This isn\u2019t to be confused with group therapy, in which you discuss your problems with others. Think of it more like a teaching and learning session in a classroom setting.DBT skills aim to help enhance your capabilities in day-to-day life. The four skills your therapist will teach include:Mindfulness: This is the practice of being fully aware and focused in the present instead of worrying about the past or future.Distress tolerance: This involves understanding and managing your emotions in difficult or stressful situations without responding with harmful behaviors.Interpersonal effectiveness: This means understanding how to ask for what you want and need and setting boundaries while maintaining respect for yourself and others.Emotion regulation: This means understanding, being more aware of and having more control over your emotions.Telephone crisis coachingDBT often involves telephone crisis coaching to support you in your daily life. This means you can call your therapist at certain times for support between sessions.Examples of when you may need to call your therapist include:When you need help with an immediate crisis, such as wanting to self-harm.When you\u2019re trying to use the DBT skills you learned but want some advice on how to do it.However, your therapist will set clear boundaries about when you can call them, such as during an agreed-upon range of time during the day.Crisis coaching functions on an as-needed basis. The calls are usually brief, and they shouldn\u2019t replace the work of individual or group sessions.Care at Cleveland ClinicMental Health CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits and risks of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)?Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been proven to help people with their mental health conditions in several studies.
