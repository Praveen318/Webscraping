It helps relax muscles and joints, reduce swelling and improve blood flow. Diathermy uses radio and sound waves to warm up the tissues beneath your skin.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is diathermy?Diathermy is a therapeutic treatment that uses electric currents (radio and sound waves) to generate heat in layers of your skin below the surface. Diathermy means \u201cdeep heating.\u201d This treatment helps relax muscles and joints, reduce inflammation and swelling, and improve blood circulation.How do electric currents generate heat?The flow of electrons between atoms is an electric current. Electric currents aren\u2019t visible to the human eye because atoms are the smallest particles that exist. Atoms make up everything in the universe (except for energy), from you to your cell phone.The movement of electrons to atoms generates heat. This movement is similar to running in a relay. Your atoms pass electrons to each other like a baton. During this process, your atoms are performing a physical activity. As you run holding your baton, the amount of energy you use during your exercise causes your body to warm up. In the same way, this physical activity generates heat among atoms running in a relay.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the types of diathermy treatment?There are three main types of diathermy treatment that produce deep heat through different energy methods, including:Short-wave diathermy: Short-wave diathermy transmits electromagnetic currents into your tissues. Like waves in the ocean, short-wave diathermy uses small bursts (pulses) of energy to create heat. Short-wave diathermy is also known as radio-wave diathermy or high-frequency diathermy.Microwave diathermy: Microwave diathermy transmits very small waves (microwaves) of electromagnetic radiation to create heat within your tissues. This type of diathermy uses the same type of frequencies as the microwave oven in your kitchen.Ultrasound diathermy: Ultrasound diathermy transmits sound waves into your tissues that encourage your tissues to vibrate, which creates heat.Another type of diathermy is surgical diathermy. This procedure uses high-frequency currents to cut tissue or clot blood during surgery.Who is a candidate for diathermy treatment?You might be a candidate for diathermy treatment if you:Experience chronic pain.Want to improve blood flow in an area of your body.Have muscles that are stiff and tense or you experience muscle spasms.Have a condition that causes inflammation.Want to heal faster after a sprain or strain.Talk with a healthcare provider to see if diathermy treatment is a safe option for you.Is diathermy treatment safe for everyone?Your healthcare provider will determine if diathermy treatment is right for you. There are certain conditions (contraindications) that could put you at risk of injury or burns if you undergo diathermy treatment. Diathermy isn\u2019t recommended if you:Have metal within your body (like sutures, pins, pacemakers, intrauterine devices).Have cancer.Have infections or open wounds.Have broken bones.Have severe conditions like heart or kidney disease.Are pregnant.Have dental fillings.Have a chronic bleeding condition.Your healthcare provider will learn more about your health history and offer a treatment option that\u2019s safe for you.AdvertisementWhat does diathermy treat?Diathermy is a treatment option for the following conditions:Arthritis.Chronic pain.Stiff muscles.Muscle spasms.Fibromyalgia.Injury recovery (sprains and strains).Edema.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a diathermy procedure?Before a diathermy procedure, your provider will instruct you to remove all metal from your body, as metal is reactive to the diathermy machine. This includes removing all jewelry and clothing that contains metal, like glasses, earrings and pants with zippers. You might need to remove all of your clothing and wear a gown during your procedure.Depending on where on your body you need treatment, your provider will have you sit or lie down on a special chair or table that doesn\u2019t have any metal on it. Your provider will prepare for the treatment by placing the diathermy machine near your body.AdvertisementWhat happens during a diathermy procedure?During a diathermy procedure, a diathermy machine sends a high-frequency electric current through a part of your body.Each diathermy procedure differs based on the type, including:Short wave: A short-wave diathermy machine uses electrodes, which are two plates placed on either side of your body (front and back side) to pass radio waves beneath your skin. The plates contain the radio waves, so they stay in one area.Microwave: A microwave diathermy machine uses a large, flexible applicator that resembles a lamp. Your provider will place the applicator close to your skin in a section of your body that needs treatment. Microwaves will project out of the applicator to heat the tissues beneath your skin.Ultrasound: Similar to an ultrasound test, your healthcare provider will place gel on your skin and hold an ultrasound probe on top of the gel to send sound waves underneath your skin. These sound waves make your tissues vibrate to provide heat.A diathermy procedure doesn\u2019t warm your entire body like an electric heater. Instead, the electric current from the diathermy machine sends waves that activate the atoms in your body to perform an activity. The movement of electrons between atoms generates heat within a small area of your body. You might feel warmth radiating from the treated area of your body.How long is a diathermy procedure?The length of time varies for each type of diathermy procedure, but on average, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes. To treat more severe symptoms, the length of time for a diathermy procedure could increase.During this time, you\u2019ll need to relax and stay very still while the diathermy machine provides heat deep within your tissues.What happens after a diathermy procedure?After a diathermy procedure, you might feel differently because of the effects of the treatment. This could cause:A decreased amount of pain or tension.Relaxed muscles.A warmer temperature of the treated area of your body.A reduced amount of swelling.Increased flexibility and range of motion.Improved healing time for sprains and strains.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of diathermy treatment?The benefits of diathermy include:Pain relief.Increases blood flow (circulation).Relaxes muscles.Reduces swelling and inflammation.What are the risks of diathermy treatment?If you undergo diathermy treatment, the most common risk is a burn from the diathermy machine. The diathermy machine creates heat within your tissues, and if the heat stays in one place for too long, it can burn. To prevent risks, your provider will observe your treatment to make sure you\u2019re safe and that the treatment is working effectively.During your treatment, your body is flowing with electric currents. This can cause a painful shock if you touch something metal. Let your provider know if you have any metal in your body, like a pacemaker. Metal negatively reacts to a diathermy machine and could cause injury.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the recovery time for a diathermy procedure?For typical diathermy procedures, you\u2019ll be able to go back to your normal routine immediately after your appointment. Depending on the reason for your treatment, you might need multiple diathermy treatments. Your provider will discuss your treatment plan with you and the frequency of your treatment to help you feel better.Diathermy is a supplemental form of treatment for many people, and it\u2019s usually done in addition to other types of treatment, like physical therapy.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?Visit your healthcare provider for a follow-up appointment after your diathermy treatment to verify that the procedure was effective in eliminating your symptoms. If you feel a burning sensation beneath your skin, visit your provider immediately.A note from Cleveland ClinicDiathermy is a safe form of treatment that provides deep heat to your tissues to relieve symptoms that affect your muscles and tissues. The procedure is painless and can offer immediate relief. If you have stiff or tense muscles, are recovering from an accident or want to improve your healing time, talk to your healthcare provider to see if diathermy treatment is right for you.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 04/24/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
