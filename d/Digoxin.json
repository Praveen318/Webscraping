PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat does digoxin do?Digoxin can:Help your heart muscle pump with more force.Slow down your heart rate.How does digoxin work?Digoxin restricts an enzyme that controls how much sodium and potassium go in and out of your heart. This allows sodium and eventually calcium to build up, which helps your heart pump more blood.Digoxin also makes electrical signals move more slowly in your atrioventricular (AV) node. Your AV node plays a role in telling your heart when to beat.

They\u2019ll tell you how often you need to do this.What is a normal digoxin level?Providers recommend a normal digoxin level range of 0.5 to 2 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter).
