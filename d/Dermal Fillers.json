Collagen is an important substance that exists all over your body, including in your skin, muscles, bones and connective tissues. Decreased amounts of collagen in your skin causes skin laxity (loose) and loss of volume. Skin becomes thinner, loses its elasticity and starts to sag.You may choose to get dermal fillers to:Add volume to sagging skin.Make your facial features more symmetrical.Plump up lips and cheeks.Smooth wrinkles and creases in your face.Some medications prescribed to treat medical conditions such as HIV and AIDS can cause thinness in your face.
