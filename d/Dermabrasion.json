You might not want to risk dermabrasion.If you have medical conditions like allergic rashes, skin reactions, fever blisters or cold sores, you could risk a flare-up. Also, if your acne is ongoing, dermabrasion isn\u2019t an option because there\u2019s a risk of infection.

Your skin may ooze and it will have a moist dressing on it for the day immediately following surgery, prior to starting wound care at home.
