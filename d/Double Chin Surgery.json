A plastic surgeon may use one of several types of surgeries, or a combination, depending on your goals:Chin liposuction (lipo): Liposuction sucks excess fat out from under the skin.Chin tuck (submentoplasty): A chin tuck focuses only on the chin and upper neck. It tightens the skin and removes extra fat.Neck lift (lower rhytidectomy): A neck lift is more extensive than a chin tuck. It removes excess skin and tightens the muscles. It covers the chin and the entire neck area.Kybella\u00ae injections: An injectable medication. If there isn\u2019t excessive fat and skin laxity, Kybella injections may be an option. This medicine helps lead to a breakdown of fat, and the by-products are eventually eliminated.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
