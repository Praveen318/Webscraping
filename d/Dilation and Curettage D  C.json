During this procedure, your provider inserts a device into your cervix to see the inside of your uterus. You may have a hysteroscopy with a D&C if your provider is trying to diagnose a problem.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a dilation and curettage (D&C)?Occasionally, before beginning the D&C, your provider may begin to dilate your cervix using a laminaria stick. They insert this thin rod into your cervix and leave it there for several hours. You can get up and walk around while the laminaria stick is inside. The laminaria stick absorbs fluid from your cervix. When that happens, your cervix opens and gives access to your uterus.AdvertisementWhat happens during a dilation and curettage (D&C)?Before the procedure, your provider will give you medicine to make you comfortable. You may have general anesthesia, where you\u2019re asleep for the procedure. Or your provider may give you medication to relax and sedate you, but you remain awake for the procedure. Your provider will recommend the best anesthesia option for you.During the procedure, you lie on a table with your feet in stirrups, like during a gynecologic exam.

It can also help detect abnormal endometrial cells, which may be a sign of uterine cancer. After a D&C, your provider sends the sample of cells to a laboratory where pathologists can identify if you have normal or abnormal tissue, polyps or cancer.A D&C may also be important for your health after a miscarriage or abortion. It removes any leftover tissue to prevent heavy bleeding and infection.What are the risks of a dilation and curettage (D&C)?A D&C is a safe, routine procedure. But like any surgery, it has some risks. D&C risks include:Uterine perforation (a small tear in your uterus), which may happen if the tip of the curette passes through your uterine wall.Uterine infection.Uterine bleeding.In rare cases, if you had a D&C after a miscarriage, you may develop Asherman\u2019s syndrome. This condition occurs when adhesions, or bands of scar tissue, form in your uterus. In Asherman\u2019s syndrome, scar tissue builds up between your uterine walls. The walls then stick together. This condition can cause infertility and change your menstrual flow. But providers can usually treat the adhesions with surgery.###Recovery and OutlookWhat\u2019s the follow-up care for a dilation and curettage (D&C)?You\u2019ll need someone to drive you home from the procedure. You can usually go home a few hours after a D&C. You might have mild pain or light bleeding for a few days. Use pads, not tampons, for the bleeding. Within a week, you should be able to get back to your regular activities. You usually return to your provider about a week or two after the procedure.Will a dilation and curettage (D&C) affect my menstrual cycle?After having a D&C, your next period may be early or late. You\u2019ll need to avoid using tampons or having sex for a while after the procedure. Until your cervix returns to its normal, closed state, you\u2019re at higher risk of bacteria entering your vagina and causing an infection. Your provider will tell you when you can resume having sex and using tampons.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider about a dilation and curettage (D&C)?Complications from a D&C are treatable when they\u2019re diagnosed early. If you notice symptoms after a D&C, call your provider so they can diagnose and treat the problem. Symptoms may include:Abdominal (belly) pain.Fever.Heavy bleeding.Severe cramps.Unusual or bad-smelling discharge, the fluid that leaks from your vagina.Additional DetailsIf I had a miscarriage, do I need a dilation and curettage (D&C)?About half of women who miscarry don't need a D&C procedure. If the miscarriage occurs before 10 weeks of pregnancy, it'll most likely happen on its own and not cause any problems. After the 10th week of pregnancy, there\u2019s a higher risk of having an incomplete miscarriage. In that case, you may need a D&C procedure to make sure your uterus is clean.You may be able to decide if you want to miscarry naturally or have a D&C procedure. Talk to your provider to decide what\u2019s right for you.A note from Cleveland ClinicA D&C, or dilation and curettage, is a procedure to remove tissue from your uterus.
