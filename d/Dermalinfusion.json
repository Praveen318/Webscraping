Like Dermalinfusion, microdermabrasion removes dead skin cells. It also stimulates collagen production to give a more youthful complexion.Some providers use a diamond-tipped wand to perform microdermabrasion. Others use a device that gently sprays tiny crystals onto the surface of your skin. Using this device, there\u2019s also an attached vacuum-like device. It suctions up the exfoliating crystals along with the detached skin cells. But this suction device doesn\u2019t deep clean your pores like Dermalinfusion\u2019s extraction step. And you don\u2019t receive a serum treatment.Dermalinfusion is also gentler than microdermabrasion. It\u2019s safe to use on sensitive skin, as well as around sensitive areas like your lips and eyes.What\u2019s the difference between Dermalinfusion and HydraFacial?The type of treatment wand is the main difference between Dermalinfusion and HydraFacial\u00ae.The HydraFacial treatment wand has a spiral tip design. The disposable tip spins. This creates a vortex effect like a mini whirlwind that sloughs away damaged skin cells.Both skin treatments exfoliate, deep-clean pores (extraction) and infuse a specialized serum into your skin.A note from Cleveland ClinicDermalinfusion\u00ae, also called a DiamondGlow\u00ae facial (formerly SilkPeel Dermalinfusion), can give you a more youthful appearance. A healthcare provider uses a diamond-tipped wand to exfoliate dead skin cells and clean out your pores. During the infusion step, you receive a topical serum for your unique skin care needs. You may get this procedure to reverse signs of aging like wrinkles or treat acne or dry skin. Dermalinfusion results are temporary because the aging process never stops.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 07/29/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
