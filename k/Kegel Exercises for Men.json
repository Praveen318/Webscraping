This muscle is one that helps you pee and poop and contracts during orgasm. It supports your lower organs.The third muscle is the iliococcygeus muscle (IC), which supports your organs and is involved in moving your anus (butthole) back into place after you poop.The BC muscle is the main one involved in doing Kegel exercises, with the other two muscles doing less of the work. You can find this muscle by stopping your urine stream while you\u2019re peeing.You can try feeling your PC muscle by attempting to draw your penis in toward your body, making it shorter.
