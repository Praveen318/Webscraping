PolicyWhat medical conditions may benefit from a keto diet?Doctors typically recommend the keto diet to treat epilepsy in children of all ages, including infants. Ketogenic diets usually are not preferred by adults, because the limited food choices make the diet hard to maintain in long run.The keto diet has been used in other neurological (brain-related) conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and autism spectrum disorder.People with diabetes or class III obesity also may benefit from the keto diet. The keto diet can be easier to observe than other diabetes diet recommendations, and it can retrain the bodies of people with obesity to start burning fat.What happens in your body when you follow a keto diet?The ketogenic diet resets how your body uses food. Usually, carbohydrates in your diet (like sugars and starches) provide most of the energy. The keto diet lowers the amount of carbs you eat and teaches your body to burn fat for energy instead.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens when your child starts a ketogenic diet?Starting the keto diet is not a one-step process. Your child will likely be admitted to the hospital for monitoring when the diet begins. The hospital\u2019s ketogenic diet team may include a neurologist, a registered dietitian and a registered nurse.Your child\u2019s ketogenic team will:First, give your child small amounts of water or sugar-free liquids.Within 24 hours, begin your child\u2019s new diet. For infants, premixed ready-to-use ketogenic formulas may be used.Blood sugar will be monitored closely in the initial 48 hours of starting the diet and hypoglycemia may occur during the initiation of the keto diet.Continually assess needs for supplements like calcium or vitamins.How does the ketogenic diet help epilepsy?The ketogenic diet has been used to reduce seizures since the 1920s. The mechanism by which the seizures are regulated is poorly understood. Both the low sugar component and high fat component uniquely alters the \u2018excitability\u2019 of the brain, thereby reducing the tendency to generate seizures.Care at Cleveland ClinicEpilepsy and Seizures TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of the ketogenic diet?Despite its success treating seizures, the keto diet is not risk free.

About two-thirds of patients with epilepsy can achieve seizure management with the use of the right medications. When epilepsy is drug-resistant, other options like epilepsy surgery and a ketogenic diet should be considered. Talk to your healthcare provider about trying the keto diet if your child has epilepsy.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 10/06/2020.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
