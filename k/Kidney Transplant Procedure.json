This helps prevent complications.Why are kidney transplants done?Kidney transplants are done to help people with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal (kidney) failure. When your kidneys can no longer filter waste properly, you\u2019ll need either dialysis (which uses a machine to remove waste from your bloodstream) or a kidney transplant.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat are the kidney transplant requirements?Each hospital has its own criteria for accepting people as kidney transplant recipients. But in general, candidates should have:End-stage renal failure and be on dialysis.Late-stage chronic kidney disease, approaching the need for dialysis.A life expectancy of at least five years.A full understanding of postoperative instructions and care.What is the best age for kidney transplant?While most kidney transplant recipients are between the ages of 45 and 65, there really is no upper age limit. However, to ensure the best results, your healthcare provider will likely look for a donor who is close to your own age.How many kidney transplants can a person have?In some cases, people can have two and even three or four kidney transplants in their lifetime. Your healthcare provider can tell you if this is an option for you.What disqualifies you from getting a kidney transplant?Kidney transplants are approved on a case-by-case basis.

Placing the kidney in this position allows it to be easily connected to blood vessels and your bladder. The vein and artery of your new kidney are attached to your vein and artery. The new kidney's ureter is attached to your bladder to allow urine to pass out of your body.What happens to my old kidneys?In most cases, your surgeon will leave your diseased kidneys inside your body.

After transplantation, you should be able to return to a more normal lifestyle and have more control over your daily living. You can have unrestricted diet and fluid intake.If you were dependent on dialysis before the transplant, you'll have more freedom because you won't be bound to your dialysis schedules.Anemia, a common problem with kidney failure, might be corrected after transplantation. If you have hypertension (high blood pressure), you could be on fewer blood pressure medications after transplantation.What are the risks of kidney transplant?The risks of kidney transplantation are the same as those of any surgery. There is the risk of bleeding, infection or breathing problems. You also might experience some side effects from the medications, and you could be more prone to infections since the medicine you will take after transplantation lowers your body's ability to fight infection.Kidney transplant rejectionSince your body recognizes the new kidney as a foreign object, it will normally try to get rid of it or \"reject\" it. However, you\u2019ll be given medicine to prevent rejection.Because of years of experience, research, and improved medicines that prevent rejection, kidney transplants are very successful with few complications after transplantation.Is kidney transplant better than dialysis?While both options have pros and cons, kidney transplant is often the preferred treatment for chronic kidney disease.

It\u2019s also a good idea to limit caffeine. It\u2019s a weak diuretic and contributes to dehydration.Don\u2019t eat raw or undercooked foods. With your weakened immune system, eating raw or undercooked foods \u2014 especially undercooked meat or undercooked eggs \u2014 at any time after a transplant puts you at risk for severe illness.Get plenty of protein in your diet.

These fruits can cause a strong reaction with medications that suppress your immune system.Don\u2019t take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Some very common over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, including ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause kidney dysfunction. You may also want to avoid taking antihistamines and antacids. These medications, and other OTC drugs, can sometimes affect other drugs or change absorption. Talk to your healthcare provider about the safety of these medications and possible alternatives you could try.Avoid certain vitamins and herbal supplements. St. John\u2019s wort, Schisandra, and some herbal teas and other natural supplements interact with transplant medications. You should discuss these supplements with your provider before using them to make sure they are safe to use.How long can a person live with a kidney transplant?People can live for many years after receiving a transplanted kidney.
