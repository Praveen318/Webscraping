PolicyWho needs knee arthroscopy?Your healthcare provider may recommend knee arthroscopy if you have knee pain that doesn\u2019t get better with nonsurgical treatments. Nonsurgical treatments include rest, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy (PT). Although arthritis causes knee pain, arthroscopic knee surgery isn\u2019t always an effective treatment for osteoarthritis.Healthcare providers use arthroscopy to get a better look at cartilage, bones and soft tissues inside of your knee.

They can happen in contact sports and those that require jumping, such as volleyball.Why do providers use knee arthroscopy?Your healthcare provider uses knee arthroscopy to:Diagnose injuries: During knee arthroscopy, your healthcare provider takes a close look at any painful or swollen areas.

Sometimes, pieces of cartilage (rubbery tissue that helps bones move against each other smoothly) can break off when your bone fractures.Inflammation: The synovium inside a joint can become inflamed (swollen and irritated).
