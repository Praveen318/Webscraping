It has many benefits for babies, especially those born early or with low birth weight. Kangaroo care can support your baby\u2019s physical health, help with breastfeeding and nurture the bond between you and your baby.What is kangaroo care?Kangaroo care is a method of holding your baby to your chest. Your baby wears only a diaper and possibly a hat and socks to help stay warm. They rest against your bare chest, allowing for skin-to-skin contact. This type of touch is a special experience that can help you and your baby bond. It also has medical benefits, particularly for babies with a low birth weight or babies born preterm.You can do kangaroo care in the hospital, including in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), as well as at home. How long you hold your baby in each session is up to you and varies depending on your situation and your baby\u2019s medical needs. Your baby\u2019s care team can offer specific guidance on how soon after birth to begin kangaroo care and how long each session should be. They\u2019ll also check whether kangaroo care is safe and doable for babies connected to IVs or other medical equipment, and they\u2019ll tell you when kangaroo care isn\u2019t possible.\u201cKangaroo mother care\u201d is another name for kangaroo care. Most research focuses on the benefits of a mother or birthing parent providing such care. But other caregivers can practice kangaroo care, too. These include fathers, other family members and trained volunteers.How to do kangaroo careYour nurse will help you get started with kangaroo care in the hospital. Each session can vary in length, but researchers generally advise longer sessions for more benefits. For example, one study shows that a two-hour session is more beneficial than a one-hour session when performed at least seven days in a row. Your care team can tell you more about what\u2019s best for your baby.Here are a few basic tips for getting started:Dress comfortably. There are no strict guidelines for what to wear. But you should wear something that you can easily open in front because your baby will rest against your bare chest. You\u2019ll also need to remove your bra if you wear one. You can use a hospital gown that opens in front if you\u2019d like.Place your baby on your chest. Your baby should be in an upright position with their head resting to one side against your chest. Your baby will typically wear only a diaper, hat and socks. The hat and socks help keep your baby warm.Cover your baby. Once you\u2019re settled skin-to-skin, drape a blanket over your baby\u2019s back. Keep your baby warm and comfortable while snuggled against your chest. Your care provider may suggest using a wrap to secure your baby against your chest.Relax together. During your session, try and relax as you hold your baby. Remember to breathe normally. This is a great time to let your baby rest and relax, too. Allow your baby to snuggle in and fall asleep. Avoid playing with your baby or rousing their attention.Plan on multiple sessions. Your care team will tell you the ideal schedule for you and your baby. Ask if anything is unclear or if you have other questions or concerns.What to avoid during kangaroo careTo make kangaroo care safe and comfortable for your baby, you should:Put away phones or other electronic devices. These can distract your focus away from your baby. Focusing on your baby is important for bonding and also for keeping your baby safe as you hold them.Make sure your skin is clean and healthy. Don\u2019t do kangaroo care if you have a rash, open cuts or cold sores. Clean your skin beforehand and don\u2019t apply any perfumes or lotions.Avoid smoking. Don\u2019t smoke before or during kangaroo care. Secondhand smoke poses many health risks for your baby.Avoid doing kangaroo care if you\u2019re sick. Your baby\u2019s immune system doesn\u2019t fully mature until they\u2019re two to three months old. So, in these early weeks, it\u2019s crucial to limit your baby\u2019s exposure to germs. If you\u2019re sick, see if another caregiver can take your place until you\u2019re feeling better. Or ask your healthcare provider if it\u2019s safe for you to do kangaroo care while wearing a facemask.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the benefits of kangaroo care?Kangaroo care has many benefits, particularly for babies born preterm or at low birth weight. Research shows that kangaroo care can help:Stabilize your baby\u2019s heart rate.Improve your baby\u2019s breathing pattern and make their breathing more regular.Support healthy sleep, including more quiet sleep and longer cycles.Encourage your baby\u2019s growth.Relieve pain your baby might feel during certain procedures like a heel prick test.Lower your baby\u2019s risk of hypothermia, serious infections or death (these outcomes relate specifically to babies born in resource-limited nations).Kangaroo care also helps you:Bond with your baby.Establish breastfeeding and increase your milk supply.Feel confident in your ability to care for your baby and respond to their needs.What is the definition of kangaroo care?Kangaroo care generally refers to skin-to-skin contact with your baby soon after birth. Researchers agree that skin-to-skin contact is beneficial for all infants and helps you bond with your new baby. Most research defines and explores kangaroo care as a practice that helps babies born early or with low birth weight. But if your baby doesn\u2019t fall into these categories, they can still benefit from skin-to-skin contact.The World Health Organization (WHO) defines kangaroo care as skin-to-skin contact between a mother and baby along with exclusive breastfeeding. (If the mother or birthing parent isn\u2019t able to do this, another caregiver can step in.) This contact should begin as early as possible after birth and happen for as many hours as possible per day. Ideally, the WHO recommends skin-to-skin contact for eight to 24 hours daily. These recommendations apply to all babies born preterm or with low birth weight.Some healthcare providers use slightly different definitions of kangaroo care. For example, some use the term to refer to skin-to-skin contact without exclusive breastfeeding. Some definitions encourage early discharge from the hospital and follow-ups once you\u2019re home. Definitions also vary in terms of how soon after birth you should begin skin-to-skin contact and how long each session should be.The key takeaway here is that you shouldn\u2019t worry too much about strict definitions. Your exact method of kangaroo care depends on many factors, including your baby\u2019s health, your own health and constraints like time and privacy. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s guidance in your unique situation.AdvertisementWhat is the history of kangaroo care?Resting your baby against your chest is a natural practice that\u2019s gone on throughout history. But kangaroo care as a named, clinically defined process began in Bogota, Columbia, in the late 1970s. Preterm babies there at this time had a high mortality rate.Two doctors in Bogota \u2014 Edgar Rey, MD, and Hector Martinez, MD \u2014 went in search of a solution to help the babies they cared for. They found one through a conversation with a village wet nurse. She explained how she bundled newborns up against her chest, and this supported the babies\u2019 health and growth.Drs. Rey and Martinez tried such skin-to-skin positioning with mothers and babies at their hospital. They termed this practice \u201ckangaroo mother care\u201d to describe how bundling your baby against your chest resembles preterm kangaroos crawling inside their mother\u2019s pouch and latching on to a nipple for feeding. The baby kangaroos stay in the pouch for many months until they\u2019re old enough to search for food on their own.The doctors\u2019 efforts in Bogota were very successful, leading to a 70% drop in deaths among preterm babies within the first year.Meanwhile, in the 1970s, researchers in the U.S. were investigating how skin-to-skin contact can help babies and parents. They discovered the minutes and hours immediately after birth are crucial bonding times for parents and their infants.In the decades that followed, researchers have continued to uncover benefits of kangaroo care and its hallmark feature of skin-to-skin contact. For example, they learned that kangaroo care helps babies sleep better and breathe more regularly. It also helps support breastfeeding and healthy parent-infant attachment.Researchers today are looking further into the benefits of kangaroo care and how it can help babies thrive in different settings. In nations with limited access to medical technologies, kangaroo care can be lifesaving. In resource-rich nations, kangaroo care can still play a valuable role in supporting your baby\u2019s health and well-being while also helping the two of you bond.Your baby\u2019s care team can tell you more about kangaroo care and its evolving place in newborn care.A note from Cleveland ClinicThe birth of your baby brings all sorts of questions to mind, as well as countless new challenges.
