While many people know about this process as a way to stop sex offenders, medical castration is used as a treatment for tumors that feed on sex hormones. The treatment, also called hormone therapy, may be used to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before chemical castration?Before your healthcare provider suggests chemical castration, they\u2019ll need to know if the type of cancer you have is the type that might respond to hormone therapy.If lowering testosterone is the goal, you and your provider might discuss orchiectomy, a surgical procedure that will permanently reduce the level of testosterone in your body. The surgery removes one or both testicles. There is a version that removes only the tissue that makes testosterone. This is called subcapsular orchiectomy. Unlike chemical castration, these procedures can\u2019t be reversed.What happens during chemical castration for prostate cancer?Male sex hormones are called androgens. They include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). One of their jobs is to make the prostate gland grow and function. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer is designed to cut down on how many androgens are made and to prevent them from fueling the growth of cancer. You might also hear it be called androgen deprivation therapy.Hormone therapy to fight prostate cancer can work in one of these ways:Decreasing the production of androgens by the testicles.Preventing androgens from being able to work in the body.Stopping any other part of the body from producing androgens.AdvertisementWhat drugs are used in chemical castration for prostate cancer?Here are the categories of medications used for chemical castration to treat prostate cancer:Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or GnRH analogs \u2014 also called luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or LHRH analogs:These medications stop the pituitary gland from releasing luteinizing hormone that tells the testicles to make testosterone. First, however, they cause a high level of hormone that\u2019s eventually ignored. At that point, you may have what\u2019s called a testosterone flare. You may need to have another type of medication (antiandrogen therapy) at the same time as you start GnRH agonist treatment to help with side effects. You\u2019ll receive these drugs as injections or as implants under your skin. Drugs in this category available in the U.S. include:Goserelin (Zoladex\u00ae).Histrelin (Vantas\u00ae).Leuoprolide (Lupron\u00ae).Triptorelin (Trelstar\u00ae).GnRH antagonists or LHRH antagonistsThese medications prevent testosterone production but without causing a testosterone flare. In the U.S., these drugs are available to treat advanced prostate cancer:Degarelix (Firmagon\u00ae), an injection.Relugolix (Orgovyx\u00ae), a pill.Antiandrogen treatmentsThese drugs stop your body from using androgens. This therapy is called complete androgen blockage. The drugs are commonly used when androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is no longer working well. They aren\u2019t used on their own but they might be combined with ADT. They include:Flutamide.Bicalutamide (Casodex\u00ae).Apalutamide (Erleada\u00ae).Nilutamide (Nilandron\u00ae).Enzalutamide (Xtandi\u00ae).Darolutamide (Nubeqa\u00ae).Androgen synthesis inhibitorsThese drugs stop androgens from being produced anywhere in the body by stopping an enzyme called CYP17 that is necessary for any tissue, including the prostate cancer tissue, to make testosterone. In the U.S., these are the androgen synthesis inhibitors (all pills) that are used:Aminoglutethimide.Ketoconazole.Abiraterone (Yonsa\u00ae, Zytiga\u00ae).Note: At one time, the female sex hormone estrogen was once used to treat prostate cancer. However, because of the side effects, it\u2019s not often used now.What happens during chemical castration to treat breast cancer?You might wonder if there\u2019s such a thing as chemical castration when it comes to treating women. Blocking hormones is a strategy for people who have breast cancer tumors that feed on estrogen and/or progesterone. This is called hormone therapy or endocrine therapy. These strategies are not permanent, which is not true for oophorectomy, the name for surgery to remove your ovaries.Treatments that affect estrogen production or useMedications include:Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen and toremifine (Fareston\u00ae). These are in pill form.Selective estrogen receptor degraders such as fulvestrant (Faslodex\u00ae). Fulvestrant is an injection.Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole (Arimidex\u00ae), exemestane (Aromasin\u00ae) and letrozole (Femara\u00ae). These are in pill form.Treatments that suppress the ovariesThese treatments include medications and surgery.Luteinizing hormone-releasing LHRH analogs, including goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron). These cause temporary menopause.Chemotherapy medications that may be permanent since they damage ovaries.Care at Cleveland ClinicUrology CareMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of chemical castration?Some benefits of chemical castration include:It\u2019s not permanent.It\u2019s been effective in managing certain types of cancer.What are the risks or complications of chemical castration?There are side effects to medications for hormone therapy for both prostate and breast cancer therapy.
