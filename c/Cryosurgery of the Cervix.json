PolicyWho needs to have cryosurgical ablation of the cervix?Cervical cryotherapy can help women who have:Abnormal cells in the cervix that can turn into cancer, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma in situ (sometimes called stage 0 cancer).Irregular bleeding from the cervix.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before cervical cryoablation?Cryosurgery takes place in a healthcare provider\u2019s office while you\u2019re awake.Before the procedure, your healthcare provider may or may not use local anesthesia, a medication to numb the area. Occasionally, you may also receive a sedative, a medication to help you relax.Your healthcare provider may offer warm blankets to keep you more comfortable.AdvertisementWhat happens during the cryoablation procedure?The procedure takes only a few minutes. While you\u2019re lying on an exam table, the healthcare provider will:Insert a metal or plastic tool called a speculum into the vagina to open it, as happens during a Pap test.Insert a hollow metal tool called a cryoprobe into the vagina. The probe contains and circulates the chemical (which is as low as \u201350 degrees Celsius).Touch the tip of the cryoprobe to the cells or tissue that need treatment. The tip of the probe will have ice crystals and be cold enough to freeze the tissue.Hold the probe in place a few minutes, until the tissue freezes at about \u201320 degrees Celsius.Wait a few minutes, then repeat the ablation if needed.What happens after cervical cryosurgery?You\u2019ll be able to go home the same day as treatment.As the frozen cells thaw, they either get absorbed by the body or flushed out through the vagina. The discharged (leaked) substance is often watery but sometimes a little thicker. It may contain a small amount of blood. This may last up to several weeks. You may want to wear a pad.Your healthcare provider will tell you how and when to follow up. Most people need a test a few weeks or months later to make sure the cells were destroyed. Options may include:Biopsy.Pap test.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of cryosurgery of the cervix?Cryosurgery is less invasive than other types of surgery, so it involves less pain, bleeding, and risk of other complications.
