Containing over 8,000 nerve endings, the clitoris is the pleasure center of the female reproductive anatomy. It\u2019s a small nub of flesh at the top of your vulva (external genitalia). The goal of clitoroplasty is to create or change the appearance of your clitoris while still retaining its pleasure-center characteristics. There\u2019s a high risk of sensory or blood flow challenges that come with a clitoroplasty.A clitoroplasty could involve:Reducing the size of your clitoris.Repositioning your clitoris.Creating a clitoris.Changing the appearance of your clitoris.There are several reasons you might get a clitoroplasty. Some of these include:Being born without a clitoris but having other female genitalia.Wanting to improve the appearance of your clitoris, usually making it smaller than before.Desiring a clitoris so your genitals more clearly align with your gender (gender affirmation surgery).Correcting damage from genital mutilation (female circumcision).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat conditions does a clitoroplasty treat?Children, teens and adults can have a clitoroplasty. A clitoroplasty can treat certain congenital conditions (conditions you\u2019re born with). A surgeon may perform a clitoroplasty as part of feminizing genitoplasty. Feminizing genitoplasty is surgery that changes the way your genitals look or fashions new genitalia from existing tissue.ClitoromegalyClitoromegaly is the medical term for an enlarged clitoris. A larger-than-average clitoris can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life. Most often, exposure to androgens (a hormone in men and people assigned male at birth) causes clitoromegaly in women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). A clitoroplasty helps people with this condition get a clitoris that\u2019s a more typical size and shape.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)CAH is an endocrine condition that can cause a person assigned female at birth to have an enlarged clitoris that resembles a penis. A clitoroplasty shapes the tissue into a more typical-looking clitoris.Female pseudo hermaphroditismThis is a condition where a person is assigned female at birth because they have ovaries and other internal female genitalia, but their external genitals appear to be male (they have a penis or scrotum). Someone with this condition may have a clitoroplasty as part of feminizing surgery.Cosmetic clitoroplastyA cosmetic clitoroplasty reduces or repositions your clitoris. This type of procedure is most common in adults whose clitoris has changed in some way. Most often, a person desires a cosmetic clitoroplasty because their clitoris affects their sexual pleasure in some way, although there can be other reasons.Gender-affirming surgery (feminizing genitoplasty)Gender-affirming procedures help some people whose sex assigned at birth differs from their gender identity. For example, a transgender woman may wish to have female genitalia. In these cases, a surgeon usually performs a clitoroplasty as part of a vaginoplasty. A vaginoplasty is surgery that creates a vagina.Clitoroplasty for atypical genitalia or intersexAtypical genitalia (ambiguous genitalia or intersex genitals) is when your sexual anatomy doesn\u2019t appear to be classically male or female. Intersex traits might be apparent when you\u2019re born, but they might not appear until later. A clitoroplasty can help people with atypical genitalia or people who are intersex achieve the external genitalia they desire. Parents should consult with their child\u2019s healthcare provider to carefully weigh the pros and cons of surgical options for their children, as surgery has long-lasting effects.Procedure DetailsHow should I prepare for a clitoroplasty?The first step is having an appointment with your healthcare team to discuss your full health history, the goals of clitoroplasty and the procedure\u2019s risks. They can answer any questions you have about the surgery and recovery. Your provider may order imaging tests or blood tests, and conduct wellness and physical exams to make sure you\u2019re ready for surgery. Let your provider know of any allergies you have or medications you take at this time.Your provider will give you instructions for the day of your surgery, including information on when to stop eating or drinking and when to arrive at the hospital or surgical center.AdvertisementWhat happens during a clitoroplasty?The exact method a surgeon uses for a clitoroplasty varies depending on why you\u2019re having the surgery and its complexity. For example, a procedure to change the appearance of a clitoris in a person assigned female at birth differs from a procedure that\u2019s part of gender affirmation.You may receive local anesthesia to numb just the treatment area while you stay awake for the procedure. Or you may get general anesthesia, which makes you go to sleep.A clitoroplasty that aims to reduce the size or change the appearance of a person\u2019s clitoris involves cutting away at excess clitoral tissue, then reshaping the tissue. The surgeon uses stitches to close any cuts (incisions).On the other hand, surgeons that need to create a clitoris use existing genital tissue to construct a clitoris. Feminizing genitoplasty typically follows a vaginoplasty, which involves removing most of the penis. Your surgeon reshapes the outer skin, turns it \u201cinside out,\u201d and inserts the tissue into your body to form a vagina. The surgeon shapes the clitoris from this same tissue. For people assigned female at birth with congenital anomalies, a surgeon uses whatever genital tissue is present to create a clitoris. The surgeon closes any incisions with stitches.Most people who have a clitoroplasty go home the same day (outpatient procedure).How long does it take?The exact timing varies, but you can expect the surgery to last between one and two hours.What happens after a clitoroplasty?Your healthcare team will monitor you after surgery to make sure your blood pressure, breathing rate and heart rate are normal.
