They can use a device or medicine to change your heart rhythm. A cardioversion can save your life if you\u2019re having a ventricular arrhythmia that could lead to a sudden cardiac arrest. In other cases, your provider schedules a cardioversion to prevent future problems.Types of cardioversionElectrical cardioversion (with a device): A defibrillator delivers a shock to your heart through handheld paddles or through electrode patches on your chest and back. If you\u2019re at high risk for dangerous arrhythmias or your heart doesn\u2019t work well, your provider may put in an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that can correct your rhythm. Wires from the device send a shock to your heart whenever you need it.Chemical cardioversion (with medicine): Your provider can give you medicine you swallow or receive through an IV. It can work in minutes, hours or even days. You may receive this medicine in a hospital so your provider can keep an eye on your heart rhythm. If you\u2019re taking this medicine at home, you\u2019ll need to stay in touch with your provider.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
