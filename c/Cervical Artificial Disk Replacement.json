This procedure is an option for certain people with cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy that have minimal degeneration of the disk.Spinal disks are located between the bones or vertebrae of the spine and act as cushions or shock absorbers for the vertebrae. The discs also contribute to the flexibility and motion of the spinal column. The discs consist of two parts:The inner portion: soft materialThe outer portion: a stronger, fibrous materialDuring the aging process, disks can weaken and develop tears or cracks in the outer portion, resulting in degenerative disc disease. Additionally, the inner portion may bulge out and press against the outer portion, resulting in pain. The purpose of artificial disk replacement is to replace the worn out disk while also preserving the spine\u2019s motion.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
