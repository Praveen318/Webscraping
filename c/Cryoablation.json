PolicyAre there different kinds of cryoablation?Cryoablation can be performed in different ways:Topically, on the surface of the skin.Percutaneously, inside your body through a small puncture (hole).Surgically, inside the body through a larger, open incision (cut).Why is cryotherapy used?Cryoablation may be used to treat several conditions:Abnormalities on the skin, such as atypical moles, warts, skin tags or actinic keratosis (precancerous skin growths).Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rate and rhythm).Cancer tumors (such as skin, liver, kidney, bone, lung, prostate and breast).Precancerous cells in the cervix.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before cryotherapy?Before cryoablation, your healthcare team will give you instructions on how to prepare. Depending on what type of cryoablation you\u2019re having and other factors, they may ask you to:Arrange for a ride home after the procedure.Report if you may be pregnant.Stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin, NSAIDs or blood thinners.Take certain medications in advance to prevent pain or infection.Tell them if you have any allergies or health conditions.Wear loose, comfortable clothing the day of the procedure, and leave jewelry and valuables at home.What happens during cryoablation?Topical cryoablation is often done in a physician\u2019s office during a regular appointment. You may not even have to change clothes, and you may not need any medication to prevent pain.If you are having percutaneous or surgical cryoablation, your healthcare team may ask you to wear a hospital gown during the procedure. You may receive anesthesia. It can prevent pain in a specific area (numbing spray or needle), make you feel relaxed, or put you to sleep so that you feel nothing.Just before cryoablation, your healthcare team will position you on an examination or surgical table. They might shave or sterilize the area. For surgical procedures, you may be connected to machines to monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and pulse.During cryotherapy, a surgeon uses a needle-like, hollow applicator called a cryoprobe. The cryoprobe contains and circulates extremely cold gas, such as:Liquid nitrogen.Liquid nitrous oxide.Compressed argon gas.When working inside your body, your surgeon uses imaging technology to locate the correct area. The specialist touches the diseased or abnormal tissue with the cryoprobe for a few seconds or minutes. The intense cold at the tip of the cryoprobe freezes and destroys the diseased tissue. Your surgeon might need to touch the diseased tissue with the cryoprobe more than once.When cryoablation is finished, your surgeon takes out the cryoprobe and closes the incision if needed. The entire process can take just a few minutes for small skin problems to a few hours for open cryosurgery.AdvertisementWhat happens after cryoablation?People usually go home the same day as cryoablation. But a few may need to stay overnight, for example, if the procedure involved a large incision or a deep tumor. Someone should drive you home after cryoablation, except for simple skin procedures.Over time, your body will naturally get rid of the dead cells.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule General SurgeryFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of cryosurgery?Compared to open surgery to remove (or cut out) diseased tissue, cryoablation is generally:Associated with fewer side effects and less scarring.Easier to recover from.Less damaging to surrounding tissue.Less expensive.Safer, with lower chances of infection.What are the risks or complications of cryoablation?Cryoablation is generally very safe.
