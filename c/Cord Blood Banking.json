Cord blood is what's left inside your baby's umbilical cord after it's cut. Your baby's umbilical cord is clamped and cut shortly after birth. The umbilical cord connects your baby to the placenta. The placenta grows in your uterus and supplies the developing fetus with food and oxygen.Umbilical cord blood is rich in stem cells. Stem cells are valuable because they help treat many life-threatening diseases. For most healthy people, making stem cells isn't a problem. Unfortunately, some people don't make enough healthy stem cells due to a severe medical condition or disease. The stem cells from cord blood can be lifesaving for these people. Cord blood banks exist to collect and store these stem cells. Healthcare providers use cord blood stem cells for transplants in sick people or for medical research.Cord blood banking is entirely optional. Some people choose to collect and store their baby's cord blood, and others do not. If you do not donate or store your baby's cord blood, it's thrown away with the placenta. Your healthcare provider typically provides information about cord blood banking during a prenatal visit.What is cord blood?Cord blood is the blood left inside your baby's umbilical cord after delivery. It's similar to regular blood and contains red and white blood cells, platelets and plasma. It also contains a special type of stem cell found in bone marrow that can help strengthen the immune system. These cells are unique because they can mature or grow into different types of blood cells. Their ability to morph into other cells makes them valuable.Stem cells help treat several diseases like leukemia, genetic disorders, diseases of the immune system and much more. Researchers have found cord blood is effective in treating up to 80 diseases.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
