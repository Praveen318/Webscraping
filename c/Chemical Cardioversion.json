How well this procedure works depends on what caused your abnormal rhythm and how long it lasted, as well as the medication your healthcare provider chooses.This type of cardioversion is also called pharmacologic cardioversion.Chemical cardioversion drugs can:Make your blood vesselsRelax your heart muscle.Make your heart\u2019s workload easier.Slow down the electrical signals that tell your heart to beat.Usually, your sinoatrial node starts your heartbeat. From there, electrical impulses go through your right atrium and atrioventricular node. Lastly, they get to your lower chambers (ventricles). When something goes wrong with this organized process of sending a signal through the parts of your heart, you can have an abnormal heart rhythm.When your heart rhythm isn\u2019t normal, your heart may not do a good job of sending blood to the rest of your body. All your cells, especially your brain cells, need a constant supply of the oxygen your blood carries. Inadequate blood flow can lead to dizziness, low energy, difficulty breathing, chest pain, general malaise and fatigue.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
