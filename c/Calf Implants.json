PolicyWhat are your calf muscles?Your calf muscles are part of your musculoskeletal system. They help you flex your feet and rotate your ankles. They\u2019re the reason you can walk, run and jump.You can see these muscles in the back part of your lower legs behind your shinbones (tibias). Your calf muscles start at your knees and extend to the Achilles tendons in your ankles.Two main muscles make up your calf muscles:Your gastrocnemius forms the bulk of your calf muscle. It\u2019s the muscle that gives your calf muscles their shape.Your soleus muscle is wide, flat and sits deeper in the leg. You can\u2019t see this muscle.What are other names for calf implants?You may also hear these terms for calf implants:Calf augmentation.Calf enhancement.Calf enlargement.Calves implants.AdvertisementWhy do people get calf implants?All sexes who want shapelier calves may choose calf implant surgery. There are many reasons why:To enhance leg shape: Most people get calf implants as part of cosmetic surgery to improve their physique. Bodybuilders may want calf implants to build up the bulk and size of their lower legs beyond what they can achieve through exercise. Or you may have underdeveloped calf muscles that are smaller or out of proportion to your thighs.To correct a leg issue: Some people with leg injuries or congenital defects that cause muscle imbalances get calf implants as part of reconstructive surgery.To achieve a masculine appearance: People assigned female at birth (AFAB) who identify as male may get calf implants as part of gender affirmation surgery. The implants give their lower legs a more muscular, masculine look.Who is a candidate for calf implant surgery?The ideal candidate for calf implants is someone who:Is exercising and strength training to build calf muscles.Has a fully formed adult musculoskeletal system.Doesn\u2019t smoke or can quit smoking before the procedure (nicotine raises the risks of surgical complications and hinders healing).Has realistic expectations about the outcomes of calf implant surgery.AdvertisementDo calf implants come in different materials and sizes?Calf implants are often made of medical-grade silicone. This soft, rubber-like material has the look and feel of muscle. You can choose between solid silicone calf implants or ones filled with silicone gel, as breast implants have. A benefit of solid implants is that your surgeon can sculpt them into the desired shape before insertion. Sculpting isn\u2019t possible with gel implants.There are also different shapes and sizes. Your surgeon will take measurements of your legs before the procedure to select the best implant shape and size. You may get one or two implants in each leg.Most people get the same calf implants in both legs to ensure symmetry. But individuals with muscle imbalances may need different-sized implants. Bodybuilders may also want different calf implants in each leg for a more dramatic look. You and your surgeon can discuss the calf implants most likely to help you achieve your goals.What other procedures may take place with a calf implant?Your healthcare provider may recommend body contouring procedures to achieve the look you seek. These procedures may take place at the same time as the implant surgery. For instance, you might get liposuction to remove fat deposits from your hips, butt and thighs.Some individuals get a fat transfer or fat grafting procedure to give even more volume to their lower legs. After using liposuction to remove fat deposits, your surgeon injects the purified fat cells into your lower legs. You may need more than one fat transfer procedure to achieve the desired look.Procedure DetailsWho performs calf implant surgery?A plastic surgeon performs calf implant surgery. This medical doctor specializes in cosmetic and reconstructive procedures. Calf implant surgery is most often done as an outpatient procedure, which means you go home afterward. The procedure may take place in a surgical suite at your healthcare provider\u2019s office, surgical center or hospital.What happens before calf implant surgery?You should follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions on how to prepare for calf implant surgery. You may need to:Get a physical exam and blood tests to ensure you\u2019re well enough for surgery.Get photographs taken to help your healthcare provider plan the procedure and compare before-and-after results.Fast (not eat or drink) for a certain period before the procedure.Not take certain medications before surgery, including vitamins and supplements.Take antibiotics to lower the chances of postoperative infection.Quit smoking.What are the types of calf implant procedures?There are two ways your plastic surgeon can place the calf implants:Subcutaneous: The calf implant goes just beneath the connective tissue between your skin and gastrocnemius calf muscle. Your surgeon may recommend this method because it\u2019s less invasive. You should recover more quickly with less pain. However, a subcutaneous implant is more prone to shifting, which can require additional surgery to correct. You may also be able to see and feel the implant, and it may give a less-than-natural look.Submuscular: The calf implant goes under your gastrocnemius calf muscle, making for a slightly longer and more painful recovery. Because your surgeon more securely and accurately places the implant into the muscle, you get a more natural look and feel.What happens during calf implant surgery?During calf implant surgery, you lie face down (prone) on the surgical table. You receive may receive general anesthesia to help you sleep through the procedure.Your surgeon:Makes a small incision into the natural crease of skin behind your knee.Inserts special surgical tools into the incision to create a space (pocket) between your connective tissue (skin) and gastrocnemius calf muscles (subcutaneous implant). Or your surgeon makes a pocket in your actual calf muscle (submuscular implant).Takes great care not to disturb the nerves; a sciatic nerve branch that provides motor and sensory functions to your lower leg and foot is here.Slides the calf implant through the incision, positioning it into the surgically made pocket.Sometimes places a thin drainage tube below the incision to temporarily drain fluids and reduce swelling (not everyone needs drainage tubes).Closes the incision with stitches and covers the wound with a bandage.Wraps your leg in a compression bandage or garment.Repeats these steps on your other calf.Finishes surgery and then gently rolls you over to the face-up (supine) position for recovery.What happens after calf implant surgery?Someone must drive you home after the procedure. You go home wearing compression bandages on your legs to keep the implants in place and minimize swelling (edema).You should follow your surgeon\u2019s instructions for incision care, as well as taking care of the drainage tubes. Your doctor will remove the stitches (if they\u2019re not dissolvable) and drainage tube within two weeks. You may stop wearing the compression bandages at this time.Care at Cleveland ClinicPlastic Surgery CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat is the point of calf implants?There are many benefits to calf implants.
