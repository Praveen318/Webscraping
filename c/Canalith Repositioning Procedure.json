The most well-known and performed CRP is the called the Epley maneuver. It involves a series of head movements that aim to relieve vertigo symptoms.With BPPV, tiny calcium carbonate crystals, called otoconia (also known as canaliths), detach from the utricle in your inner ear and move into the semicircular canals instead. When this happens, changes in your head position can trigger episodes of vertigo.The Epley maneuver focuses on moving the canaliths out of your semicircular canals. It helps reduce BPPV symptoms, but it doesn\u2019t work on other types of vertigo.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
