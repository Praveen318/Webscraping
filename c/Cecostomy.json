Accidental bowel leakage can make daily activities challenging, significantly affecting your quality of life.Who is this procedure for?A cecostomy is an option when you have a medical condition that causes severe fecal (bowel) incontinence or constipation. These conditions include:Congenital malformations, such as imperforate anus.Hirschsprung disease.Klippel Feil syndrome, a rare disorder in which spine bones (vertebrae) fuse where they shouldn\u2019t join together.Spina bifida.How can cecostomy tube surgery help?To construct a cecostomy, your healthcare provider makes a small hole in the cecum, the first part of your large intestine. They insert a small tube that extends from your skin\u2019s surface to your cecum.A cecostomy tube enables a special enema technique (antegrade enema) to clear your bowels. An enema is a treatment that delivers a liquid solution to your large intestine, making it easier for stool (poop) to pass.Retrograde enemas are a traditional method for treating fecal incontinence. This method uses a squeeze bottle to deliver the solution through your anus while you\u2019re lying down. You then need to wait up to an hour for it to work.Antegrade enemas are possible when you have a cecostomy tube. Instead of delivering the enema solution through your anus, you attach a drip bag with a tube to the external part of the cecostomy tube. This process occurs while you\u2019re sitting on the toilet.Is a cecostomy right for me?You may benefit from a cecostomy if you have:Fecal incontinence.Ongoing severe constipation.Regular soiling episodes.The ability to sit on the toilet for as long as necessary.Not achieved good results with other fecal incontinence therapies.Not had previous abdominal surgery that would affect cecostomy tube placement.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
