Your eye, like a camera, has a lens that focuses light. Your lens is made mostly of water and proteins. As a cataract forms, the proteins naturally start to break down, causing the lens to become cloudy and yellowed. Aging is the most common cause of cataracts. However, certain medical conditions and medications, injuries and previous eye surgeries can also cause cataracts.A cataract prevents light from properly passing through your lens. As a result, you develop symptoms like blurry vision, halos around bright lights or double vision.Cataract surgery removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear, artificial lens. An ophthalmologist performs the surgery and helps you select the type of intraocular lens (IOL) that\u2019s best for you.Most people have an IOL implanted as a part of their cataract surgery. IOLs are clear so light can pass through and be focused by your eye as it should. IOLs offer different focusing powers to correct nearsightedness and farsightedness.Your surgeon may also offer specialty IOLs to correct astigmatism and presbyopia. While these aren\u2019t covered by insurance, they may help you depend less on glasses or contacts after your cataract surgery.Cataract surgery is currently the only proven way to treat cataracts in adults. For most people, surgery restores vision and has no complications. It\u2019s a quick, outpatient procedure with a fast recovery. You may only need surgery in one eye. If cataracts in both eyes require surgery, your ophthalmologist will schedule two surgeries a week or two apart.How painful is cataract surgery?Most people feel little or no pain during or after cataract surgery. You\u2019ll receive a topical anesthetic (eye drops) to numb your eye during the surgery. Shortly after surgery, your eye may feel gritty or slightly tender, but over-the-counter pain medicine should improve this.Who needs cataract surgery?You may need surgery if cataracts in one or both eyes are causing vision problems that interfere with your usual activities.Your eye care specialist may also recommend cataract surgery if they need to see the back of your eye to manage other eye conditions like:Age-related macular degeneration.Diabetes-related retinopathy.It\u2019s important to know that cataract surgery won\u2019t treat vision loss from these other conditions. It only improves vision loss due to cataracts.How do I decide if it\u2019s time for cataract surgery?Cataracts aren\u2019t a medical emergency. So, if you\u2019ve just learned you have cataracts, don\u2019t feel rushed or pressured into scheduling surgery. You can usually wait to have the surgery until the timing is best for you.When you first notice cataract symptoms, a new prescription for glasses or contacts might help. But cataracts usually get worse over time. Once cataracts keep you from doing what you need or want to do, it may be time for surgery. Talk to your eye surgeon about the best timing for surgery in your individual situation.How common is cataract surgery?Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgeries in the U.S. and globally. Researchers estimate that each year, surgeons perform over 3 million cataract surgeries in the U.S. and 20 million around the world. About half of all people who live into their 90s will need cataract surgery.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
