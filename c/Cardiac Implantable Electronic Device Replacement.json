The procedure may replace an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a pacemaker. In most cases, it\u2019s a simple outpatient procedure that doesn\u2019t require overnight hospitalization.Who needs CIED replacement?The most common reason for CIED replacement is because the battery reaches the end of its lifespan, has a low charge or can\u2019t hold a charge. The batteries typically last six to 10 years, so you may have multiple replacements in your lifetime. Your healthcare provider checks your generator at appointments, so they will know when your generator\u2019s battery nears the end of its lifespan.Other reasons for device replacement may include:Your healthcare provider recommends a newer version of the device or one that has additional capabilities.Your implantable device malfunctions or stops working entirely.You develop an infection that requires device removal (rare).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWho performs CIED replacement?A physician, such as a heart surgeon, cardiologist or electrophysiologist (healthcare provider specializing in the heart's electrical impulses), performs CIED replacement.What happens before CIED replacement?Your healthcare provider will provide detailed instructions about how to prepare for your ICD or pacemaker replacement surgery. They may:Ask you to stop taking certain medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin.Do cardiac testing such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or echocardiogram.Perform blood tests to make sure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens during CIED replacement?Most types of CIED replacement only involve replacing the battery-powered generator under your skin. That means a healthcare provider doesn\u2019t need to perform major surgery to remove the leads attached to your heart. But in some cases, your healthcare provider needs to remove or replace the entire device, including the leads. This is a more complex procedure.If you have a leadless pacemaker, your healthcare provider either turns off the existing device and implants a new device (the old device stays in place), or they use a catheter (a thin, flexible tube-like device) to remove the old device through a vein. Retrieving these devices through a vein is possible because leadless pacemakers are much smaller than traditional pacemakers.During the procedure to replace the generator, your healthcare provider:Gives you intravenous (IV) sedation through a vein in your arm.Makes an incision (cut) in your skin over the implanted device.Detaches the generator from the leads and removes the generator.Implants the new generator and connects it to the leads.Closes the incision with stitches or glue.What happens after CIED replacement?You stay in the hospital or outpatient surgery center for several hours after your device replacement surgery. Your health care team monitors you as you recover from sedation. Most people can go home the same day as the procedure.Care at Cleveland ClinicHeart Failure TreatmentsFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of CIED replacement?CIED replacement helps your implantable device function at its best.
