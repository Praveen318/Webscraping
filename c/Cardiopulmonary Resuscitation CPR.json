Even if you don\u2019t know CPR, you can help someone by using \u201chands-only\u201d CPR. To give the person the best odds of survival, you need to take immediate action. Start CPR while someone else calls 911 and looks for an AED (automated external defibrillator).ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewCPR keeps blood moving after cardiac arrest.What is CPR?Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a way to save the life of someone who\u2019s in cardiac arrest (when someone\u2019s heart is no longer able to pump blood) by attempting to restart their heart. It\u2019s a fairly simple technique that anyone can learn. The key part of CPR is chest compressions, which keep blood flowing to vital organs until a regular heartbeat returns. Breaths of oxygen bring more oxygen into the person with cardiac arrest.When is CPR used?A person of any age needs CPR if they:Collapse.Don\u2019t respond.Aren\u2019t breathing.Don\u2019t have a pulse.More than half of all people who have cardiac arrest outside of a hospital don\u2019t get help right away. If you receive CPR right after you go into cardiac arrest, your chance of survival can double or even triple.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before CPR?Before starting CPR, follow these steps:After ensuring a safe scene, loudly ask the person if they\u2019re OK.Call 911 if you see someone collapse. The 911 dispatcher can guide you through the steps to take until paramedics arrive.Ask someone nearby to get an automated external defibrillator (AED).Tilt the person\u2019s head back while they\u2019re lying on their back.Listen for 10 seconds to see if you hear the person breathing.Check to see if the person is breathing or to see if their chest is going up and down.Check for a pulse by feeling the side of their neck.Perform CPR if you don\u2019t feel a pulse.How to do CPRIf the person isn\u2019t breathing, put one of your hands over the other and place them in the middle of the person\u2019s chest (right under their nipples).Putting the force of your body weight behind it, push your hands down hard in the middle of the person\u2019s chest. Use the heel of your hand, or the part just before your wrist. Keep your arms straight.Keep pushing on the person\u2019s chest (called doing compressions) 100 to 120 times per minute, pushing down 2 inches each time. Make sure you allow their chest to come all the way back up between compressions.People who have CPR training can pause compressions to give the person two mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths for every 30 compressions (about 20 seconds or so).Keep doing chest compressions and giving rescue breaths in a cycle until the person revives or more help arrives.Perform the rescue breath as follows:Pinch the person\u2019s nose closed while tilting their head back a little and their chin up.Close your mouth over theirs and blow a breath into it so their chest goes up. If the person\u2019s chest doesn\u2019t come up, check to see if there\u2019s something in their mouth.Give a total of two breaths and go back to doing compressions.While you\u2019re doing CPR, someone should be bringing an AED to use for help with resuscitating the person.You can do CPR even if you don\u2019t have training in how to perform CPR. If a teen or adult is in cardiac arrest, call 911 and do chest compressions until emergency help arrives. This is called \u201chands-only CPR.\u201d By distributing oxygen currently in the person\u2019s body, it can help someone in cardiac arrest until someone with CPR training arrives.It can be easier to remember the CPR compression rate if you follow the beat of these songs:\u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d by the Bee Gees.\u201cWalk the Line\u201d by Johnny Cash.\u201cCrazy in Love\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z.\u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie\u201d by Shakira.If you\u2019re doing CPR on an infant as a single rescuer, put one hand on their forehead to keep their head slightly back to provide proper rescue breaths. Use two fingers of your other hand to do compressions that go a third or half the depth of their chest. The number of compressions and breaths is the same as for adults.If you\u2019re a two-person rescue team, while one person provides rescue breaths, the other person should use a two-hand method. Place both thumbs in the center of the chest (below the nipple) with the remaining fingers wrapped around the sides of the infant. Deliver compressions with the two thumbs. Use the same number of compressions and breaths as for adults.AdvertisementWhat happens after CPR?After first responders take over caring for the person receiving CPR, they\u2019ll get them to a hospital as soon as possible. If the person survives, healthcare providers will look to see if there\u2019s any organ damage from a lack of oxygen. They\u2019ll also determine the cause of cardiac arrest and provide whatever treatment the person needs. Many people who survive cardiac arrest stay in a coma, but about half wake up.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of this procedure?By keeping blood moving through a person\u2019s body, CPR prevents organ damage in someone who\u2019s in cardiac arrest.AdvertisementWhat are the risks or complications of CPR?CPR comes with risks because of how hard chest compressions have to be to keep blood circulating. It\u2019s possible to break ribs and injure organs within the chest during CPR.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the recovery time?It can take several months for mild issues with memory, learning and concentration to get better in people who survive cardiac arrest and awaken from a comatose state.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?If you see someone having a cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately.After surviving cardiac arrest, you\u2019ll need follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. The timing of the appointments will vary depending on your condition. Be sure to contact your provider if you aren\u2019t getting better or if you have new symptoms during your recovery.Additional Common QuestionsWill CPR break ribs?Yes, it\u2019s possible that CPR can break a person\u2019s rib. This is possible because you have to push down hard in order to pump blood from the heart throughout a person\u2019s body.What is CPR without mouth to mouth?\u201cHands-only\u201d CPR, described above, doesn\u2019t involve mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It\u2019s still a valuable form of CPR that can help a person\u2019s blood flow until professional emergency help arrives.AED vs. CPRMany public places have an automated external defibrillator (AED) that people can use in emergency situations. Anyone can use an AED, which delivers a life-saving shock to a person in cardiac arrest. When you use it in the right way, the shock restores a normal heart rhythm. Most AEDs have easy-to-use instructions on them, but a 911 dispatcher can also help you use the AED. You should use AEDs alongside CPR, not instead of CPR.You should start CPR and ask someone to call 911 and look for an AED.A note from Cleveland ClinicMost cardiac arrests that happen outside a hospital happen at home, so you could be helping a relative or friend if you know CPR. Even \u201chands-only\u201d CPR can help a person stay alive until first responders arrive. CPR increases a person\u2019s chance of surviving cardiac arrest, but it\u2019s important to act quickly.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 09/13/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
