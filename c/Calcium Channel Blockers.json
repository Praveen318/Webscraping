Because your heart and circulatory system need calcium to function, these medications treat high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems and more.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyHow do they work?Calcium is an electrolyte, which means it has a positive charge when it\u2019s dissolved in water. Your body uses ions (atoms with an electrical charge) in electrolytes to transport things into and out of your cells. Your body is always working to balance things out. That means when calcium ions enter a cell, sodium ions leave, and vice versa.Those ions enter and exit your cells using channels, which act just like doorways to the inside of your cells. Those channels also have a type of security feature, which only allows ions that have the right type of charge (either positive or negative) and the right size to enter and exit.Calcium channel blockers take advantage of the fact that certain types of calcium channels tend to exist only in certain parts of the body. This allows targeting of medications depending on which channels they affect.There are many calcium channels on each of the cells in question. At the right dosage, calcium channel blockers (sometimes calcium channel antagonists) only block some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of them. That slows down those cells\u2019 use of calcium because there are fewer ways to bring it inside.What conditions are treated by this class of medication?Calcium channel blockers' main uses are to treat heart and circulatory conditions. In the United States, they\u2019ve been previously approved to treat the following:High blood pressure (hypertension).Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms).Chest pain (angina).Coronary artery spasm.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).Pulmonary hypertension.Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding into the space between the brain and the skull).In addition to the officially approved uses, calcium-channel blockers are also frequently prescribed off-label. This means while the medications aren\u2019t officially approved to treat a condition, there\u2019s evidence that they can still safely do so. Off-label prescribing is a legal practice, and it\u2019s medically acceptable so long as healthcare providers do so safely and responsibly.Off-label uses of calcium-channel blockers include:Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.Prevention of migraines.Anal fissures.High-altitude pulmonary edema, a type of altitude sickness.Studies are also looking at calcium channel blockers because they may help delay or prevent diseases that will be more severe if you have high blood pressure earlier in life. Those diseases include dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.AdvertisementAre calcium channel blockers commonly prescribed?Calcium channel blockers are very commonly prescribed, especially for high blood pressure. Millions of adults in the United States receive a prescription for a calcium channel blocker each year.Are there different types of calcium channel blockers?Calcium channel blockers come in two main types.Dihydropyridines (pronounced dy-hy-dro-py-rid-eens). These target blood vessels and cause them to relax, which is why they\u2019re so effective in treating high blood pressure (the exception is nimodipine, which treats subarachnoid hemorrhage).Non-dihydropyridines. There are two calcium channel blockers approved in the U.S. that aren\u2019t dihydropyridines. These medications target heart muscle as well as blood vessels, and they are effective at treating heart rhythm problems.DihydropyridinesNondihydropyridinesAmlodipineDiltiazem (benzothiazepine)Clevidipine (in-hospital use only)Verapamil (phenylalkamine)FelodipineIsradipineNicardipineNifedipineNimodipineNisoldipineDihydropyridinesDihydropyridinesAmlodipineNondihydropyridinesDiltiazem (benzothiazepine)Clevidipine (in-hospital use only)NondihydropyridinesVerapamil (phenylalkamine)FelodipineNondihydropyridinesIsradipineNondihydropyridinesNicardipineNondihydropyridinesNifedipineNondihydropyridinesNimodipineNondihydropyridinesNisoldipineNondihydropyridinesAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of calcium channel blockers?Calcium channel blockers have several advantages that make them commonly prescribed.They\u2019re effective. Calcium channel blockers are effective in people of all ages and races and can treat many related heart and circulatory problems.They can target certain conditions. Depending on the type of medication used, different effects are more likely to happen.They can be a better option. Many medications can help control blood pressure, but some aren't a good choice for certain people. That can happen because of other health conditions, medications they're already taking, life circumstances and more. In those cases, a calcium channel blocker are a better choice for treatment.They can work alongside other medications. Certain medications combine calcium channel blockers with other medications, especially drugs that treat conditions like high cholesterol. Combined therapy makes it easier for people to take their medications and treats multiple problems at once.What are the possible side effects and complication risks of these medications?In general, the following side effects are possible with calcium channel blockers:Dihydropyridines:The most common side effects are:Feeling lightheaded or dizzy.Feeling flushed.Headaches.Swelling in your limbs.Non-dihydropyridinesThese medications are more likely to cause:Constipation.Slow heartbeat (bradycardia).Reduction in your heart\u2019s blood pumping ability.Many calcium channel blockers can cause gingival hyperplasia, which is when your gums grow too much around your teeth. They may also cause an increase in symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or heartburn.What should I do if I take one of these medications and miss a dose?The dosing of calcium channel blockers is very important for them to be effective and safe. Because of that, if you miss a dose of one of these medications, you should never try to \u201ccatch up\u201d by taking an extra dose, as even doubling your dose may be dangerous. This is especially true with verapamil, which strongly affects the timing and strength of your heartbeat, meaning it can be deadly if you take too much.What are the reasons I should not take these medications?In general, patients who have certain types of heart problems or low blood pressure may not be able to take calcium channel blockers. Other reasons why you may not be able to take some of these medications include pregnancy, heart problems, liver problems, or certain types of irregular heart rhythms.Do calcium channel blockers interact with any other medications?Calcium channel blockers can interact with many medications. This is especially true of any medication that lowers your blood pressure or affects your heart rate. You may also want to avoid taking calcium channel blockers with grapefruit (either the fruit or the juice) because it can affect how your body absorbs these medications.In general, your healthcare provider or pharmacist is the best source of information on medication interactions. You shouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask them if you have any questions about interactions.Recovery and OutlookHow long can I stay on calcium channel blockers?In general, calcium channel blockers taken by mouth are safe for long-term use.
