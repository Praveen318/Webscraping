The process involves flushing the colon daily with water through a stoma (surgical opening) in the abdomen. You don\u2019t need to wear a colostomy bag. People with inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer may need a colostomy and irrigation.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewColostomy surgery overviewWhat is a colostomy?A colostomy is a surgical procedure that connects part of the large intestine (colon) to a surgical opening in the abdominal wall (stoma). As part of the digestive system, the large intestine helps move poop (stool) out of the body.When you have a colostomy, stool exits the body through the stoma instead of the rectum. A bag that attaches to the stoma (skin) collects the stool. You empty this bag several times during the day.Some people need colostomies for a short time while the colon or rectum heals. A surgeon then reattaches the ends of the intestine and closes the stoma. Other people need permanent colostomies.A colostomy is different than an ileostomy, which also moves stool out of the body. It connects the small intestine (ileum) to a surgical opening in the abdominal wall.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is colostomy irrigation?Colostomy irrigation is a way to remove stool without wearing a colostomy bag all the time. You use the stoma to wash out the colon with water (like an enema). You perform this procedure at the same time every day, or every other day, depending on your needs.Who needs colostomy irrigation?People with certain digestive tract disorders that affect the large intestine (colon and rectum) may need a colostomy. While there are several conditions that need this, the more common ones include:Anal cancer or colorectal (colon) cancer.Cervical cancer or vaginal cancer.Diverticulitis.Fecal incontinence.Hirschsprung disease.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn\u2019s disease.Intestinal injury or trauma.Large bowel (intestinal) obstruction.AdvertisementWho is a candidate for colostomy irrigation?Irrigation works best when stool is firmer. For this reason, irrigation is only an option if you have one of these colostomy types:Descending: The descending colon, which runs down the left side of the abdomen, connects to the stoma. Solid stool starts to form in this part of the colon.Sigmoid: A sigmoid colostomy connects the last part of the bowel (sigmoid colon) to the stoma. The sigmoid colon moves solid waste into the rectum.Procedure DetailsWhat colostomy irrigation supplies do you need?You need special medical supplies to perform colostomy irrigations.
