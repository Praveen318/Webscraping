PolicyWhy is cervical cerclage performed?There are several reasons why your healthcare provider may recommend cervical cerclage during your pregnancy. Some reasons for cervical cerclage include:Incompetent (weakened) cervix. This can happen due to past surgeries such as LEEP procedures or other surgeries on cervical tissue.Past miscarriages from an abnormally shaped uterus or damage to your cervix.Past miscarriages during the second trimester that suggest weakened cervix.It\u2019s important to discuss with your healthcare provider any past pregnancies, miscarriages and procedures you\u2019ve had. If your healthcare provider thinks you may benefit from a cervical cerclage procedure, they\u2019ll perform it at about 12 to 14 weeks into your pregnancy, before your cervix thins out.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a cervical cerclage procedure?Before your cervical cerclage procedure, your healthcare provider will go over your health history and discuss with you any past complications from pregnancies or surgeries you may have had on your cervix.They\u2019ll examine your cervix prior to the procedure by placing a speculum inside of your vagina so they can see your cervix clearly, similar to when you have a routine Pap exam. They may also do a transvaginal ultrasound. Your healthcare provider will likely ask you to abstain from sexual intercourse for a week prior to your procedure.It\u2019s normal to feel nervous or have questions before having a cerclage procedure.

But if you have a weakened cervix, a cervical cerclage procedure is the best way to prevent preterm labor (labor that begins before 37 weeks). The advantages are clear.What are the risks or complications of having a cervical cerclage procedure?Your healthcare provider will only recommend a cerclage procedure if the benefits outweigh the risks. But, as with almost any medical procedure, there are some risks to be aware of with a cervical cerclage procedure. These include:Infection.Damage to your cervix.Bleeding.Premature rupture of membranes. This means your water breaks before it should. The fetus rests inside of your uterus in amniotic fluid, also called \u201cbag of water\u201d or \u201cmembranes.\u201d The rupture of your membranes could trigger preterm labor.Preterm labor.Cervical stenosis (permanent narrowing of your cervix).Scar tissue on your cervix.Tearing of your cervix or uterus if labor progresses while sutures are still intact.Recovery and OutlookWhat things should I not do after a cervical cerclage procedure?Your healthcare provider will want you to take it easy for a week to 10 days after your cerclage procedure to allow time for your cervical stitches to heal properly.

They\u2019ll likely advise you to:Abstain from sexual intercourse or inserting anything inside of your vagina such as douches or other feminine products.Take it easy. Refrain from strenuous exercise or lifting heavy objects.Is it OK to have sex after a cervical cerclage procedure?Your healthcare provider will want you to abstain from sexual activity for a week before your cervical cerclage procedure and probably for a week to 10 days after your procedure to allow your cervical stitches time to heal.When can I go back to work or school after a cervical cerclage?Cervical cerclage is an outpatient procedure typically performed by your healthcare provider in their office or a hospital setting.

While it might be scary to consider cerclage treatment, this procedure is successful in nearly 90% of cases. But people diagnosed with short or incompetent cervix in a pregnancy can have this condition in subsequent pregnancies.
