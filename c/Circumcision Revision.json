It can cause scar tissue to form as an infant grows and develops more fat in the area around the penis.Buried penis. Circumcision revision may also be needed if the penis drops back into the fatty area surrounding it, seeming to \u201ctrap\u201d it. This causes a buried penis, making it difficult to urinate and increases the risk for skin infections around the penis.Penile skin bridge.
