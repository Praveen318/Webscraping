This class of medications can help if other heart medicines don\u2019t work, but you need low doses for safety.ContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat are cardiac glycosides?Cardiac glycosides are medicines that can help people with certain heart conditions. You take them as either a tablet, liquid or capsule. People usually take it once a day at the same time of day.How cardiac glycosides workCardiac glycosides work by inhibiting (holding back) cell membranes from pumping sodium out. This increases the amount of sodium that stays in your cells. This allows more calcium to build up in the cells. When your cells release the calcium, it creates stronger heart muscle contractions. This leads to a higher stroke volume, meaning your heart pumps more blood with each heartbeat. This can increase the total amount of blood your heart pumps, which is called the cardiac output.Having stronger heart muscle contractions and better cardiac output helps people with heart failure.These medications also can slow down electrical signals in the atrioventricular (AV) node that controls your heartbeat. This slows down your heart rate, which can also help people with heart failure, especially if they have other heart problems such as atrial fibrillation.What are examples of cardiac glycosides?Cardiac glycosides examples include digoxin (Cardoxin\u00ae and Lanoxin\u00ae), digitalis and digitoxin. They come from the digitalis (foxglove) plant, which is where they get their names. Other cardiac glycoside drugs include oleandrin, bufalin and ouabain. Digoxin is the most commonly prescribed cardiac glycoside.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
