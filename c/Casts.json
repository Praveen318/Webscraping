You might even be able to choose a color.What is a cast?A cast firmly holds a part of your body in place. Healthcare providers use casts to stabilize and protect your body after an injury.Healthcare providers refer to wearing a cast as a form of immobilization \u2014 it prevents that part of your body from moving. Unlike splints, you can\u2019t take a cast off or adjust it while you\u2019re wearing it.Which injuries require wearing a cast?Casts are most commonly used to hold a part of your body in place while you\u2019re healing after a bone fracture (a broken bone). You might need a cast after other injuries or some types of orthopaedic surgery, too, but that\u2019s much less common.Your provider will custom-fit a cast to the part of your body that has a broken bone, including your:Arm or elbow.Wrist and hand.Leg or knee.Ankle.Foot.Types of castsThere are two types of casts \u2014 fiberglass and plaster. Fiberglass casts are more common. Fiberglass is lighter and more durable than plaster. It\u2019s also porous (not airtight) so air can get through it, which can make wearing a cast more comfortable. You might be able to choose a specific color if you need a fiberglass cast.Plaster is easier to work with and form to your body\u2019s shape, but most providers use fiberglass these days. You might need a plaster cast if you experience a displaced fracture (your broken bone is pushed out of its usual place). Plaster can sometimes be better than fiberglass because it\u2019s easier to mold around your bone, but it\u2019s still less common.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a cast is applied?Before a healthcare provider puts a cast on your body around the broken bone, they\u2019ll examine your injuries. They\u2019ll also set (realign) your bone to make sure it heals back together correctly. Depending on which type of fracture you experience, you might need a closed reduction or surgery to set your bone.During a closed reduction, your provider will physically push and pull your body on the outside to line up your broken bones on the inside. They\u2019ll give you a type of anesthesia to make sure you don\u2019t feel pain during the closed reduction.The most severe fractures need surgery. The most common type of bone fracture surgery is internal fixation. Your surgeon will insert pieces of metal into your bone to hold it in place while it heals. They\u2019ll give you general anesthesia so you sleep through the surgery.Your provider will put a cast on once they\u2019ve set your bone and it\u2019s safe to immobilize it.How is a cast applied?A healthcare provider will apply a cast to your body in layers:They\u2019ll put a layer of soft, stretchy fabric called a stockinette on your body around the broken bone.Next, they\u2019ll roll cotton or another soft padding over the stockinette. The padding and stockinette put light, constant pressure on the area to help it heal and prevent swelling.Fiberglass and plaster both come in rolls of strips. Your provider will moisten the strips and lay them around your body.They\u2019ll keep layering fiberglass or plaster strips around the fracture until they\u2019ve completed the cast.How long does it take to get a cast?It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to around an hour to apply a cast. How long it takes depends on which type of cast you need and where on your body you need it. Smaller casts (like on your wrist) take less time, and bigger casts (like on your legs) take longer to apply.How long does it take for a cast to dry?It depends on which type of cast you\u2019re getting. Fiberglass casts start drying right away and might only take a few hours. Plaster casts usually take a day or two to completely harden.Be careful with your cast while it\u2019s still drying. It won\u2019t have its full strength or protection until it\u2019s hardened all the way. Fiberglass will look and feel rough when it\u2019s dry. Plaster will look smooth and white when it\u2019s hardened.Your provider will give you specific instructions for taking care of your cast while it\u2019s drying.AdvertisementWhat happens after a cast has dried?For the first few days after you get a cast, you should:Elevate the cast as often as you can. You can prop the cast up on couch cushions or pillows for extra support.Ice the cast to prevent swelling. Make sure the ice or ice packs don\u2019t drip or sweat on the cast. Put ice in a sealed bag and wrap it in towels to prevent moisture from getting in or on your cast.Move your fingers or toes if you have a cast on your arm or leg. Your provider will tell you how often to move to prevent stiffness.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Orthopaedic CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of having a cast?Casts are usually the best way to protect a bone while it heals after a fracture.
