It helps reduce the look of tired eyes from your lower lids and removes drooping skin from your upper lids. While the surgery is typically safe, there are risks involved. Talk with a board-certified ophthalmologist about the risks and benefits of the surgery.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsOverviewAlso called an eye lift, a blepharoplasty is a procedure that reduces bagginess from your lower eyelids and removes excess skin from your upper eyelids.What is blepharoplasty?Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery, can improve the appearance of the area around your eyes. It\u2019s a procedure that reduces bagginess from your lower eyelids and removes excess skin from your upper eyelids. As skin ages, it gradually loses its elasticity. A lack of elasticity, combined with the relentless pull of gravity, causes excessive skin to collect in your upper and lower eyelids. Blepharoplasty can be performed on your upper eyelids, lower eyelids or both.Blepharoplasty often means removing excess skin, muscle and underlying fatty tissue. But sometimes providers can reposition tissues rather than removing them. While it\u2019s primarily a cosmetic procedure, blepharoplasty can also improve the field of vision in people whose sagging upper eyelids obstruct their visual field.Blepharoplasty with fat removal doesn\u2019t eliminate dark circles under your eyes or remove crow\u2019s feet or other facial wrinkles. Other surgical and nonsurgical procedures that reposition fat, fill the hollows under the eyes or lift your cheeks can improve dark circles. Providers can perform blepharoplasty at the same time as other facial surgery procedures, such as laser resurfacing or brow lifts.Who is a good candidate for blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)?The best candidates for blepharoplasty surgery are generally people at least 30 years old who are in good health and have no other eye conditions. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following conditions:Eye disease, like glaucoma, dry eyes or a detached retina.Thyroid disorders, like Graves\u2019 disease, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.Cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure or other circulatory disorders.Diabetes.Be realistic about the expectations you have for blepharoplasty. Eyelid surgery can enhance your appearance and help build your confidence. But you shouldn\u2019t expect the surgery to drastically change your look. Many people have eyes that aren\u2019t perfectly aligned or that appear to be different sizes. Asymmetrical features occur during the early stages of development. Blepharoplasty won\u2019t alter your facial structure. It\u2019s important to know your face well before you decide to have surgery. Think carefully about your expectations and discuss them with your surgeon.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow should I prepare for eyelid surgery?To prepare for a blepharoplasty procedure, your ophthalmologist (an eye care specialist) or oculoplastic surgeon may ask you to:Get a medical evaluation or lab testing done.Quit smoking.Adjust your current medications or start taking certain medications.Stop taking anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, blood thinners, multivitamins and herbal supplements, as they can all increase your risk of bleeding.You\u2019ll need to arrange for a trusted family member or friend to drive you home from surgery. They\u2019ll also need to stay with you the first night after the procedure.What happens during a blepharoplasty procedure?Depending on your goals and the recommendation of your surgeon, blepharoplasty can involve your upper eyelids, lower eyelids or both.Upper blepharoplastyDuring an upper blepharoplasty, your surgeon will make cuts (incisions) in the natural crease of your upper eyelid. These incisions will be hidden when your eyes are open. Your surgeon will remove excess skin and protruding fat, and then they\u2019ll close the incisions.Lower blepharoplastyDuring a lower blepharoplasty, your surgeon will make an incision just below your lower eyelash line. They\u2019ll remove excess skin in your lower eyelid through this incision. They may also use an incision hidden inside your lower eyelid (transconjunctival incision) to correct lower eyelid issues and redistribute or remove excess fat.How long does a blepharoplasty procedure take?A surgeon can typically complete an upper blepharoplasty in about 45 minutes to one hour. It takes about two hours if both upper and lower eyelids are done at the same time, depending on whether fat is repositioned or if there\u2019s additional work performed.AdvertisementWhat happens after a blepharoplasty procedure?There will be a stitch in each of your upper lids that\u2019ll remain for about a week. The lower lids don\u2019t require stitches if the incisions are made on the inside of your lids. It\u2019s common for swelling and bruising to occur in your upper and lower lids. Expect to stay home from work and limit your activities for several days after surgery to allow your eyelids to heal.Risks / BenefitsAre there possible complications with blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)?As with any surgical procedure, there\u2019s some degree of risk.

Your surgeon will give you specific instructions that may include:How to care for your eyes.Medications to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site.When to follow up with your surgeon.How long does a blepharoplasty last?Blepharoplasty won\u2019t stop your eyes from aging. But the results usually last a long time. Upper eyelid surgery can last anywhere from five to seven years to an entire lifetime, while lower eyelid surgery rarely needs to be done more than once.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Some people experience dry eyes after surgery, but the condition rarely lasts more than two weeks.
