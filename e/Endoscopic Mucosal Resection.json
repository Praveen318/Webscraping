Your digestive, or gastrointestinal, tract is the series of organs your food travels through as it\u2019s digested. The technique allows your healthcare provider to reach your digestive tract without making any incisions from outside your belly. This means you experience less pain and recover faster after endoscopic mucosal resection than after open surgery.During the procedure, a gastroenterologist (a doctor specializing in gastrointestinal diseases) uses a long, flexible tube with a camera called an endoscope. After sedation, they insert the endoscope through your mouth or anus, depending on what part of your digestive tract they need to reach. Then, they insert surgical tools through the endoscope to remove irregular tissue.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
