PolicyWhat is angina?Angina is a sign of coronary heart disease that affects more than 10 million Americans. When you have angina, your heart doesn't receive enough oxygen-rich blood due to narrowed or blocked arteries. In chronic stable angina, symptoms such as chest pain or weakness come and go when you are active or under stress.What conditions can EECP therapy treat?Your healthcare provider may recommend EECP if you have:Chest pain.Cough.Fatigue.Shortness of breath (dyspnea).EECP can also help other conditions, including:Cardiac syndrome X (a type of angina).Cerebrovascular disease.Heart failure.Kidney (renal) failure.Left ventricular dysfunction (an early stage of heart failure).Lung disease (pulmonary disease).Peripheral artery (vascular) disease (PAD).EECP cannot treat unstable angina (acute coronary syndrome). This type of angina causes more severe, more frequent and longer-lasting symptoms. Symptoms develop suddenly, even while you rest.Call 911 or have someone take you to the nearest emergency room if this occurs. You could be having a heart attack.AdvertisementHow does EECP therapy work?EECP treatment applies pressure to blood vessels in your lower limbs. The pressure increases blood flow back to your heart, so your heart works better. When your heart pumps better, symptoms ease.This type of therapy can also encourage blood vessels to open new pathways for blood to flow to your heart. These pathways eventually become \"natural bypass\" vessels that help relieve symptoms of angina if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked.Who is eligible for EECP therapy?You may be eligible for EECP therapy if you:Have long-term chest pain or pressure that comes and goes during physical activity or stress.No longer experience relief with medication.Don\u2019t qualify for an invasive procedure like surgery.Experience renewed symptoms after an invasive procedure such as bypass surgery, angioplasty or stenting.AdvertisementWho should not undergo EECP therapy?Talk to your healthcare provider about whether you qualify for EECP therapy.

This treatment relieves heart disease symptoms that can\u2019t be controlled by medicine or treated with surgery.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before EECP therapy?Before you receive EECP therapy, a healthcare provider performs a physical exam and exercise stress test. Your provider also explains the procedure and equipment involved.Immediately before treatment, a provider:Asks you to empty your bladder and change into special treatment pants.Places three electrocardiogram (EKG) patches on your chest and inflatable cuffs around your legs and buttocks. The cuffs connect to air hoses.Gives you a finger sensor to check blood oxygen and pressure levels, so providers can adjust therapy for best results.What happens during EECP therapy?During EECP therapy, you relax or nap on a padded table while air fills the cuffs around your lower limbs. You'll feel the cuffs grow tighter around your legs and bottom until they reach full treatment pressure.EKG and blood pressure monitors synchronize inflation and deflation with your heartbeat. The cuffs inflate as soon as your heart rests, increasing blood supply to the arteries that deliver blood to your heart. Then they quickly deflate to make it easier for your heart to pump again.Once you get used to the sensation, therapy should be comfortable. It shouldn\u2019t cause pain or discomfort. You can return to your regular daily routine after treatment.How long does EECP therapy last?EECP therapy is an outpatient treatment.
