PolicyWhat are the different types of endometriosis surgery?Endometriosis surgery involves the removal of endometriosis. There are two different approaches:Laparoscopy. This minimally invasive procedure is the most common approach to endometriosis surgery. Endometriosis laparoscopic surgery treats mild to severe cases by skilled surgeons trained in this method. During the procedure, they\u2019ll make a small incision in your abdomen so they can insert a tiny tube with a camera (laparoscope) through it. In some cases, they may need to make more than one small incision.Laparotomy. Healthcare providers don\u2019t use this open surgery approach as often as they used to. Laparotomy is more invasive than laparoscopy. It involves making one large incision across the abdomen, rather than a few small incisions. Your surgeon might perform laparotomy when the condition is severe or when you don\u2019t qualify for laparoscopy.Who needs endometriosis surgery?A healthcare provider can help determine whether or not you need endometriosis surgery. Surgery may be beneficial if:You have chronic (long-standing) or severe pelvic pain.You need to remove areas of endometriosis in your pelvic area.Medication no longer relieves your endometriosis symptoms.You have difficulty getting pregnant.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat should I expect before endometriosis surgery?Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for endometriosis surgery.
