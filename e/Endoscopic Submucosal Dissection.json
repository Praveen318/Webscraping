During the procedure, a gastroenterologist (doctor specializing in gastrointestinal diseases) uses a long, flexible tube with a camera called an endoscope. They insert the endoscope through your mouth or anus (butthole), depending on which part of your digestive tract they\u2019re treating. Then they insert surgical tools through the endoscope to remove irregular tissue.Endoscopic techniques allow your doctor to reach your GI tract without making any incisions. This approach means you recover faster and with less pain than after open surgery.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
