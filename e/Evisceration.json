You can receive a prosthetic eye after both types of surgeries. Enucleation is often the surgery of choice for certain types of eye cancer.A note from Cleveland ClinicHearing that eye evisceration is suggested as a treatment would concern most people.

Your eye care provider will give you all the necessary information and support before and after this treatment. It\u2019s important that you ask for answers to your questions and for any type of service that\u2019ll make your recovery easier and more useful.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 05/30/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
