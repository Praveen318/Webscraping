Heavy periods happen for lots of reasons. There are different methods used for endometrial ablation, but they all involve destroying a layer of tissue that surrounds your uterus. When it\u2019s time for your period, you\u2019ll bleed less because you\u2019ll have less of your uterus lining to shed.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is endometrial ablation?Endometrial ablation is a procedure that uses heat, cold or different types of energy to destroy the lining of the uterus. If heavy periods are a problem, your doctor may recommend an endometrial ablation as an option to treat them. It\u2019s less dangerous and has fewer limitations than a hysterectomy. However, many patients try medications to control their bleeding before having an endometrial ablation. After an endometrial ablation, you may have no bleeding, less bleeding or no change in your bleeding during your periods.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is considered a heavy period?Periods are considered heavy if they:Cause you to be anemic because you lose a lot of blood every month.Last more than 7 days.Interfere with your ability to do your normal activities.Who can have endometrial ablation?Endometrial ablation can help control heavy periods when medications don\u2019t provide relief. You may be a candidate for endometrial ablation if:You\u2019re absolutely sure you don\u2019t want to get pregnant and have a tubal ligation (tubes tied), your partner has a vasectomy or you are willing to use some form of birth control.Your doctor does not find a cause for your heavy periods, such as cancer or thyroid disease.AdvertisementWho should not have this procedure?Endometrial ablation isn\u2019t for everyone. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your bleeding and determine if endometrial ablation is an option for you. Generally, you shouldn\u2019t have an endometrial ablation if:Your healthcare provider hasn\u2019t evaluated your bleeding.Your uterus is an abnormal shape.You or your partner are not sterilized (tubal ligation or vasectomy) or you are not willing to use birth control after the procedure.You are post-menopausal.Additionally, some people with fibroids or who\u2019ve had certain surgeries on their uterus are not able to have an endometrial ablation.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before endometrial ablation?Your healthcare provider will make sure that endometrial ablation is the right procedure to reduce your bleeding. During this evaluation:You\u2019ll take a pregnancy test. You can\u2019t be pregnant during an endometrial ablation.Your provider may do a biopsy to look for abnormal cells in your uterus and make sure you don\u2019t have cancer.Your provider will check what medicines you\u2019re taking. You\u2019ll want to be sure that you\u2019re not taking medicine that could cause problems during the procedure (for example, if you\u2019re taking a blood thinner).Your provider will order an MRI or ultrasound to take a closer look at your uterus.You\u2019ll prepare for the day of your endometrial ablation.Plan for someone to pick you up afterwards.Depending on the type of endometrial ablation, you may take medicine that thins your uterus lining.Plan to fast (no food or drink) 8 hours before the procedure.AdvertisementWhat happens during endometrial ablation?An endometrial ablation may be done in the office or in the operating room. You\u2019ll be given a gown and an IV. You\u2019ll situate yourself on a table as if you\u2019re having a pelvic exam. You may be given medicine about an hour before the endometrial ablation to help manage any discomfort after the procedure. Depending on the type of endometrial ablation, your provider may numb your pelvic area and give you sedatives so that you don\u2019t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.During endometrial ablation, your healthcare provider inserts a delicate, wand-like device into your vagina. This device extends through your cervix and into your uterus, where it can reach the lining. Depending on the type of endometrial ablation, the device sends energy, heat or cold to destroy part of the lining. The technology makes things quick and you should have minimal or no discomfort during the procedure.What are the types of endometrial ablation?There are different types of endometrial ablation, but they all involve destroying the lining of your uterus.Microwave: A small applicator releases microwaves that heat the lining of your uterus, destroying parts of it. The process takes from three to five minutes.Radiowaves (radiofrequency): A wand-like instrument with a mesh tip unfurls inside your uterus, just enough so that radio waves can reach the lining. The mesh releases radio waves that heat and destroy parts of the lining. The process takes from one to two minutes.Electricity (electrosurgery): A small, tube-like device with a viewing lens (resectoscope) is fitted with a wire loop, roller ball or laser that releases electricity. The electricity destroys parts of your uterus lining. The viewing lens helps your provider see inside your uterus and monitor the electrical currents as they turn parts of the lining into scar tissue. This type of ablation is the least common and may require you to have anesthesia. You\u2019ll probably need to go to a hospital for electrosurgery.Heated fluid (hydrothermal): A thin, flexible tube with a viewing lens that lets the doctor see inside your body (hysteroscope) moves room-temperature saline into your uterus. Once inside, the saline is heated to a temperature hot enough to destroy the lining. The process takes about 10 minutes. This kind of ablation works well for uteruses that have an irregular shape.Heated balloon (balloon therapy): A tiny balloon is placed onto a thin tube (catheter). A fluid is pumped through the tube and into the balloon and heated. The heat causes the balloon to expand and touch the uterus lining. The heat from the balloon destroys those parts of the uterus lining that it touches. The process takes from two to 10 minutes.Cold (cryoblation): A tube with a cold tip creates tiny ice balls that freeze parts of the uterus lining, destroying it. The process takes from 10 to 20 minutes.What happens after endometrial ablation?Have a friend or family member drive you home. Pay close attention to your body. You\u2019ll probably notice some changes after you\u2019ve had the endometrial ablation. They\u2019re normal, so there\u2019s no need to worry.You may feel a little nauseous.You may have to pee more the first day after the procedure.You may have period-like cramps for one to three days after an endometrial ablation.You may have light bleeding or pink discharge for a few weeks after. It\u2019s usually heaviest on Day 2 and Day 3 after you\u2019ve had the procedure. You\u2019re bleeding the uterus lining that was destroyed so that you don\u2019t have a heavy period later.Give yourself time to heal. Don\u2019t douche or use a tampon the first 3 days after you\u2019ve had the procedure.Care at Cleveland ClinicAbnormal Period TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsEndometrial ablation can stop heavy bleeding without having to take medicine every day. It\u2019s a common procedure. Still, the procedure does destroy tissue, which means it has risks:Heavy bleeding.An allergic reaction.Puncturing the uterus.Harming organs near the uterus.The technology that turns healthy tissue into scar tissue is designed to be precise, though, so that only a safe portion of the uterus lining actually gets destroyed.People who have experienced menopause or are high-risk for endometrial cancer shouldn\u2019t have this procedure. After menopause, the risks for developing endometrial cancer increase. Destroying endometrial tissue makes it harder to find cancer cells in the uterus. The risk of missing cancer cells outweighs the benefits of lighter periods.How will endometrial ablation affect my weight?Endometrial ablation won\u2019t make you gain or lose weight.How will endometrial ablation affect intimacy?It\u2019s important to follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions.
