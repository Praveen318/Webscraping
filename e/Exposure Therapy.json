Fears may be things, situations and/or activities.When we\u2019re afraid of something, we tend to avoid the objects, activities or situations related to it. While this can help manage panic in the short term, over time, it can make our fears worse. In addition, avoiding certain places, situations and activities can interfere with your quality of life.Exposure therapy helps show you that you\u2019re capable of confronting your fears. You\u2019ll learn to attach new, more realistic beliefs to the things you\u2019re afraid of. You\u2019ll become more comfortable with the experience of fear.What specialist should I see for exposure therapy?Several mental health professionals have training in exposure therapy.

For example, if you have PTSD, your therapist may ask you to describe aspects of the trauma.In vivo exposure therapy: \u201cIn vivo\u201d means \u201cin real life.\u201d This type of therapy involves directly facing a thing, situation or activity you fear. For example, if you have a fear of heights (acrophobia), your therapist might have you safely walk across a bridge or look out a window of a tower.Interoceptive exposure therapy: This therapy involves triggering physical symptoms that develop when you experience intense panic or fear, like a pounding heart or shaking. You learn that while the symptoms may be uncomfortable, they aren\u2019t harmful. This approach is especially helpful for people who fear the physical sensations that happen when they panic more than the specific thing or activity.Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE): This therapy uses virtual reality technology to simulate things, situations or activities you fear. It\u2019s helpful for situations in which in-person (in vivo) exposure isn\u2019t practical, like if you have a fear of flying on airplanes (aerophobia).There are also different types of exposure therapy based on the timing of it:Graded exposure: Your therapist asks you to list your feared objects, activities and situations in order of intensity. You start with mild to moderately difficult exposures and progress to more difficult ones over time.Flooding: This has the same approach as graded exposure, but you start with the most difficult and intense exposures first.Prolonged exposure therapy: This approach involves gradually coming closer to trauma-related memories, feelings and situations. It typically lasts about three months with weekly individual sessions, resulting in eight to 15 sessions. Therapists most often use this approach for people with PTSD.Systematic desensitization: This approach involves combining exposure activities with relaxation exercises. This can help the exposure experiences feel more manageable. It also helps you associate your fears with positive and calming activities.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow does exposure therapy work?Your therapist will ask questions about your fears and anxiety to better understand your experiences.

You\u2019ll remain near it or in contact with it until your anxiety gradually goes away. You\u2019ll experience several exposure activities over time to work on this process.Therapists typically begin with mild to moderate exposure and build to more intense exposure.

Once you feel comfortable at that level of exposure, you may then look out of a window on the third floor of a building and gradually go higher and higher.Your therapist will teach you strategies to manage your feelings of fear and anxiety in these situations. For example, if you experience an increased heart rate and shortness of breath when you face your fear, your therapist will teach you how to respond with slow, controlled breathing or other relaxation strategies.Your therapist will continue to increase the intensity of exposure until you experience healthy interactions with the originally feared situation, activity or object.How long will I need exposure therapy?The length of exposure therapy varies based on:The severity of your fear or anxiety.The complexity of your mental health condition.Your willingness to commit to the therapy.In general, exposure can increase as rapidly as you can tolerate it.
