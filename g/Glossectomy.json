PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a glossectomy?First, a healthcare provider will perform a physical examination. They\u2019ll likely order imaging tests, like CT scans or MRI scans. They\u2019ll also perform a biopsy of your tongue. During a biopsy, your healthcare provider takes a small sample of tissue and sends it to a pathology lab for analysis.Prior to your glossectomy procedure, your healthcare provider will give you a list of preoperative instructions. You should follow these guidelines closely.What happens during a glossectomy procedure?First, your provider will give you general anesthesia for your comfort during the procedure.If you\u2019re having a partial glossectomy, your surgeon will remove the diseased portion of your tongue. Then, they\u2019ll close the incision with sutures (stitches). Sometimes, your surgeon places a tissue graft to fill the hole left behind.If you\u2019re having a hemiglossectomy, half of your tongue removed, you may also need a tracheostomy. Your provider will let you know if this is something you should prepare for.For a total glossectomy, your surgeon removes your entire tongue. They\u2019ll reconstruct your tongue with tissue from somewhere else on your body. To ensure blood flow, your surgeon will connect any remaining blood vessels to the new piece of tissue.In some cases, your surgeon can create a new tongue. To do this, they\u2019ll take a tissue graft from your forearm, chest or thigh. Your healthcare provider can talk to you about your options prior to your surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens after a glossectomy?Following glossectomy, most people need to stay in the hospital for about a week. During this time, your medical team will monitor your recovery.You\u2019ll also meet with a speech and language pathologist. They\u2019ll help you re-learn how to speak and swallow properly after your glossectomy.In some instances, your healthcare provider may recommend radiation therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.

Possible complications include:Bleeding.Infection.Difficulty swallowing.Nerve injury or damage.Airway blockage due to swelling.Rejection of transplanted skin.Cancer recurrence (return).Recovery and OutlookWhat is the recovery time after glossectomy?After glossectomy surgery, length of recovery time is totally dependent on how much of your tongue your surgeon had to remove. Some people may be able to eat and drink normally after two weeks. People who have a total glossectomy may lose swallowing function. Your provider can tell you what to expect in your situation.You\u2019ll still need to work with a speech and language pathologist following your glossectomy.Can you talk after a glossectomy?It depends on how much of your tongue your surgeon had to remove.

However, if your surgeon had to remove over half of your tongue during glossectomy, you may have trouble distinguishing certain tastes (dysgeusia). It\u2019s important to note, though, that some people who undergo total glossectomy can still taste and enjoy food.How does glossectomy affect speech?While glossectomy is certain to affect speech, the degree of language impairment varies depending on how much of your tongue your surgeon had to remove. But speech therapy plays a key role in developing language skills after glossectomy.One way that healthcare providers measure communication skills is through something called speech intelligibility. Speech intelligibility refers to how well others can understand a person when they\u2019re speaking. Your speech and language pathologist will work with you to improve speech intelligibility after your glossectomy.One research study looked at speech intelligibility scores following glossectomy and how much these scores improved after speech therapy:Type of Glossectomy ProcedureSpeech Intelligibility Before Speech TherapySpeech Intelligibility After Speech TherapyPartial glossectomy6% to 24%24% to 46%Total glossectomy0% to 8%18% to 42%Type of Glossectomy ProcedureType of Glossectomy ProcedurePartial glossectomySpeech Intelligibility Before Speech Therapy6% to 24%Speech Intelligibility After Speech Therapy24% to 46%Total glossectomySpeech Intelligibility Before Speech Therapy0% to 8%Speech Intelligibility After Speech Therapy18% to 42%When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?If you\u2019ve recently undergone a glossectomy, there are certain warning signs to watch for.
