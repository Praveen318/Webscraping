PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before gum contouring?Before your gum contouring procedure, a dental provider (usually a dentist or periodontist) will meet with you to discuss your cosmetic goals. They\u2019ll ask what you like about your smile, and what you\u2019d like to improve. They may even take photographs of your smile so you can come up with a treatment plan together.During your initial consultation, your provider will do a dental exam. It\u2019s important to be in good oral health before having a gum contouring procedure. So, they\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t have cavities, gum disease or other oral health conditions that need treatment first.Next, your provider will look at your gum-to-tooth ratio to determine how much tissue they\u2019ll need to remove. They\u2019ll also consider factors like lip position, tooth wear and your facial bone structure to achieve the right symmetry and balance.Finally, your provider will check the bone levels around each tooth. If you have too much bone around your teeth, they may need to remove a very small amount. Without this step, your gums may grow back to where they were before the procedure. Your dentist or periodontist can tell you if this step pertains to you.What happens during gum contouring?Before beginning surgery, your dentist or periodontist will give you local anesthesia to numb your gums. Many providers also offer sedation dentistry options to keep you comfortable. If you\u2019re interested in sedation, be sure to discuss this with your provider during your initial consultation. You\u2019ll need to arrange for a trusted friend or family member to drive you to and from your appointment.Once you\u2019re comfortable, your provider will:Use a special pen to mark the location of your new gum line.Remove excess gum tissue using either a scalpel (traditional gum contouring) or handheld laser (laser gum contouring).Remove very small amounts of bone around each tooth, if necessary. (Not everyone needs this step; it depends on your unique tooth anatomy.)Reshape your remaining gum tissue to give you a more balanced, uniform look.Use sutures to slow bleeding, if necessary.Gum contouring surgery takes one to two hours, on average. Procedure length depends on a few factors, including how many teeth need treatment and whether you receive sedation.AdvertisementWhat happens after gum contouring?It takes a couple of hours for the numbness from the anesthesia to wear off. Once it does, you\u2019ll probably have mild soreness. You can take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications to ease any discomfort.If you had sedation, your driver should take you home right after the procedure. You\u2019ll be groggy, so you should rest as much as possible and avoid driving for the remainder of the day.Care at Cleveland ClinicPeriodontal Disease TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of gum contouring?Cosmetic gum reshaping can:Make your smile more uniform.Make your teeth more proportional to the rest of your smile.Make small, boxy teeth larger.Eliminate extra gum tissue that covers your teeth.Bring balance and symmetry to an uneven gum line.AdvertisementWhat are the risks or complications of gum contouring?There are risks with any type of surgery.

In most cases, you\u2019ll need to wait about eight to 12 weeks before your provider can determine whether you need another procedure.Gum contouring recovery tipsTo give yourself the best chance of a speedy, comfortable recovery:Take medication as directed. It\u2019s normal to have some soreness after gum contouring. But you shouldn\u2019t have severe pain. To ease discomfort, take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) or ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae). Your provider may also prescribe antibiotics to reduce your risk of infection.Avoid exercise or heavy lifting. Getting your heart rate up can increase bleeding, swelling and pain. Skip the gym for the first five days and reintroduce these routines slowly.Keep the surgical area clean. Reducing bacteria in your mouth helps speed recovery and reduce your risk of infection. Your provider can give you detailed instructions on how to brush and floss your teeth after gum contouring. They may also recommend an antibacterial mouthwash.Eat soft foods. Examples include eggs, yogurt, pasta, cooked vegetables and smoothies. Eating these foods for the first few days gives your gums time to heal. Avoid hard, crunchy or spicy foods for about one week.When can I go back to work or school?Most people can return to work, school and other routine activities after one to two days. Your gums will likely need a week to fully heal, so take it easy and listen to your body.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my dental provider?After gum contouring, you should call your dentist or periodontist if you develop:Severe pain that doesn\u2019t go away with medication.Bleeding that won\u2019t stop.Fever over 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).Pus or infection near the surgical site.Additional Common QuestionsDoes gum contouring hurt?Your provider will give you local anesthesia, so you shouldn\u2019t feel anything during the procedure. Like any surgical treatment, it\u2019s normal to feel some degree of discomfort after your appointment. Your provider will recommend medications to help ease these side effects during your recovery.Is gum contouring permanent?In most cases, gum contouring yields permanent results.
