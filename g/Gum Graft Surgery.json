It treats gum recession, a condition where your gums pull away from your teeth and expose the roots underneath. Exposed teeth roots increase your risk of tooth decay, sensitivity and bone loss around teeth. Gum grafting replaces the lost tissue around your teeth and improves your overall oral health.Gum grafting surgery is usually done by a periodontist (a gum specialist). In the U.S., a periodontist receives three additional years of focused training after graduating from a four-year dental school.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs to have gum grafting?Your dentist will likely recommend gum grafting if you have gum recession. In many cases, receding gums are a symptom of severe gum disease, but people can also be genetically prone to thinning gums. You can also develop gum recession if you brush too aggressively.How common is gum graft surgery?Gum grafting is one of the most common periodontal procedures performed in the U.S.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before gum grafting?If your dentist suspects that you need gum grafting, they\u2019ll refer you to a periodontist for an examination. Your periodontist will check the health of your gums and measure the pockets around your teeth. They\u2019ll also check to see how much recession you have around each tooth.Depending on the severity of your condition, your periodontist may want to monitor the recession. Or they may recommend moving ahead with gum graft surgery. Your periodontist will discuss your treatment options with you in detail during your consultation.What happens during gum graft surgery?There are many gum grafting techniques and materials available. Periodontists commonly take tissue from your palate (the roof of your mouth) and move it to the area of recession. In some cases, though, they may use a substitute grafting material, which they can purchase from a licensed bone and tissue bank.During a gum graft surgery, your periodontist will:Give you local anesthesia. This numbs your teeth and gums in that area. Many periodontists also offer sedation dentistry options for your comfort, including nitrous oxide, oral sedation and IV sedation. Be sure to ask about your options during your initial visit.Prepare the site. Once you\u2019re comfortable, your periodontist makes an incision (cut) and creates a small flap in your gums. They\u2019ll also thoroughly clean your teeth roots.Harvest the gum graft. Next, your surgeon creates another incision on the roof of your mouth and removes a small wedge of inner tissue. The outer layer remains intact. They\u2019ll close the site using sutures or periodontal dressing. (If your surgeon decides to use donated tissue, they\u2019ll skip this step.)Place the gum graft. Next, your surgeon places the gum graft over your exposed teeth roots (the area of recession).Place sutures. Finally, your surgeon repositions your gum tissue and stitches it into place. Your periodontist might use stitches that fall out on their own. Or you might need to have them removed at your follow-up visit.How long does gum graft surgery take?It depends on how many teeth have gum recession. If you only need one gum graft, it usually takes about an hour. If you need multiple grafts in different areas of your mouth, it could take longer.Does gum graft surgery hurt?You\u2019ll be numb during your gum graft surgery, so you won\u2019t feel anything during the procedure. You\u2019ll probably have mild soreness after your procedure, but your periodontist will give you medications and post-surgical instructions to help minimize your discomfort.AdvertisementWhat happens after gum grafting?After your gum graft surgery, you\u2019ll probably have gauze and dressing in place. Typically, you can remove the gauze after about 30 minutes. The dressing may fall out on its own during the first few days or your provider may remove it at your next appointment. Your surgeon will monitor you until it\u2019s safe for you to go home. If you had sedation for your procedure, you\u2019ll need a trusted friend or family member to drive you.Your periodontist will provide you with detailed post-surgical guidelines. You should follow these closely to reduce your risk of pain and infection.What\u2019s the gum graft recovery timeline?Your surgeon will probably want to check on your gum graft one week later. Then, you\u2019ll have routine follow-ups until your periodontist releases you back to your general dentist for continuing care.During this time, they\u2019ll provide you with specific instructions. In general, here\u2019s what you can expect:The first dayFollowing your procedure, you\u2019ll experience some bleeding, swelling and discomfort.

Don\u2019t brush or floss around the gum graft until your surgeon says it\u2019s safe.The second weekSwelling and bruising should begin to fade, and your comfort level should continue to improve. Ask your surgeon when it\u2019s safe to begin decreasing your medication dosage.As your comfort level improves, you can incorporate more solid foods.
