PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat are examples of orthodontic treatment?There are several treatments that fall under the specialty of orthodontics. Some of the most common include:BracesBraces gradually shift your teeth into their desired positions over time using a combination of brackets, bands and wires. There are different types of braces depending on your needs, including traditional metal braces and clear (ceramic) braces.Clear alignersClear orthodontic aligners are a popular alternative to braces. Well-known brands include Invisalign\u00ae and ClearCorrect\u00ae. Rather than using brackets and wires to straighten your teeth, these systems use a series of custom-made, clear aligner trays. You wear each set of trays for one to two weeks before switching them out for the next set in the series. Over time, the clear aligners shift your teeth into their proper positions.RetainersIf you wear braces or clear aligners, you\u2019ll need a retainer once your orthodontic treatment ends. A retainer is a custom oral appliance that keeps your teeth from drifting out of their proper positions. Your orthodontist can tell you how often you\u2019ll need to wear your retainer to maintain the results of treatment.Palate expandersOrthodontists recommend some treatments during childhood. This is because a child\u2019s facial bones are still developing and they\u2019re much easier to move and manipulate. A palate (palatal) expander helps to widen a child\u2019s upper jaw. Most children don\u2019t need palate expanders. But under the right circumstances, these devices can create extra space without the need for tooth extractions or other procedures.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dental CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of orthodontics?The cosmetic benefits of orthodontics are clear.
