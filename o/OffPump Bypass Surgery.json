It takes a blood vessel from one part of your body and uses it to bypass a blocked coronary artery. Unlike traditional CABG, off-pump surgery doesn\u2019t stop your heart or use a heart-lung bypass machine. Instead, the surgeon stabilizes your beating heart during surgery.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is off-pump bypass surgery?Off-pump bypass surgery is a type of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. CABG surgery takes an artery or vein from one part of your body (called a graft) and uses it to bypass a blocked coronary artery. The surgery restores normal blood flow to your heart.During traditional CABG surgery, the surgeon stops the person\u2019s heart. A cardiopulmonary bypass machine does the work of your heart and lungs throughout the surgery. The machine takes blood out of your body, adds oxygen, removes carbon dioxide, then puts oxygenated blood back into circulation.But off-pump bypass surgery doesn\u2019t use a heart-lung machine. Instead, the surgeon operates while your heart is still beating. It\u2019s also called \u201cbeating heart\u201d surgery.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs to have off-pump bypass surgery?Off-pump bypass surgery is a treatment option for coronary artery disease (CAD).In a person with CAD, plaque builds up in the arteries, restricting or blocking blood flow. It can cause symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath. A completely blocked artery can lead to a heart attack.Severe cases of CAD that don\u2019t respond to lifestyle changes, medications and other procedures may require bypass surgery. It can improve symptoms, reduce the risk of a heart attack and improve survival. Off-pump bypass surgery is an option for some people who choose CABG.How long does an off-pump CABG take?Bypass surgery takes several hours, depending on how many arteries are bypassed.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow can I prepare for off-pump bypass surgery?Your surgical team will give you instructions to help you prepare. Instructions may include:Quit smoking.Stop taking certain medicines, such as anticoagulants.Avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight the day of surgery.What happens before off-pump bypass surgery?Before off-pump surgery, your surgeon may order some tests to make sure you\u2019re healthy enough for the operation:Blood tests.Chest X-ray.Echocardiogram (echo).Electrocardiogram (EKG).Nuclear cardiac stress test.AdvertisementWhat happens during off-pump bypass surgery?Your surgeon will explain what to expect during off-pump bypass surgery. The team will:Shave the area for the incision if needed.Administer anesthesia to put you to sleep and prevent pain.Make an incision and remove a piece of blood vessel from another area of your body (chest or leg, for example).Make an incision down the middle of your chest and separate the breastbone. A left chest incision between your ribs may be an option depending on the number and location of blockages.Use a device to stabilize your heart to reduce movement.Use a band, clamp or tape as a mini-tourniquet to stop blood flow in the blocked artery.Attach one end of the graft to your aorta and the other end to the blocked artery, just past the blockage. This creates a new channel to bypass the blockage.Remove the mini-tourniquet, allowing blood to flow through the new channel.Close your breastbone and the incision (using wires, stitches, staples or other methods).What happens after off-pump bypass surgery?After off-pump bypass surgery, you\u2019ll be moved to a recovery room, where the surgical team will monitor you.

Your surgeon will help you decide which is best for you.On-pump CABG provides a surgical area that\u2019s still and free of blood for better stability and visibility.But off-pump bypass surgery may involve a smaller incision, shorter hospital stay and faster recovery.
