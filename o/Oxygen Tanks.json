A healthcare provider will teach you how to use your oxygen tank.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat are oxygen tanks?Oxygen tanks are large metal cylinders that store oxygen under pressure (compressed oxygen). They\u2019re part of oxygen therapy. If you have a lung condition or difficulty breathing, oxygen tanks help your body get the oxygen it needs to function.The oxygen may be in gas or liquid form. The tanks come in many different sizes. Some are large and difficult to move, so you only use them in a hospital setting or at home. Others are small, so you can take them with you when you go out. You receive the oxygen either through a plastic mask that fits over your nose and mouth or a flexible plastic tube with two prongs that go into your nostrils (nasal cannula).What are the types of oxygen tanks?The main types of oxygen tanks include:Compressed oxygen. The atmospheric air most people breathe every day consists of about 20% oxygen. The rest is nitrogen, along with small amounts of other gases. Compressed oxygen gas is at least 99.5% oxygen. A compressed oxygen tank has a gauge on the top that tells you how much gas is in the tank. A regulator allows you to breathe in compressed oxygen when you inhale and stops as you exhale.Liquid oxygen. A liquid oxygen tank carries 100% oxygen as a very cold liquid. Oxygen turns into a liquid at -297 degrees Fahrenheit (-182.8 degrees Celsius). Manufacturers then compress it into a liquid oxygen tank. When you release the oxygen from the tank, it turns into gas. You must be careful around liquid oxygen. Accidental exposure can cause cryogenic burns (a burn from extremely cold temperatures) or frostbite.Oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators create purified air by pulling air around you, separating and compressing the oxygen and removing the nitrogen. They run on electricity \u2014 you can either plug them into a wall or use batteries. Unlike compressed oxygen or liquid oxygen, you don\u2019t have to refill a tank to get oxygen.What conditions are treated or managed with oxygen tanks?Oxygen tanks can help if you have:Asthma.Bronchitis.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Cystic fibrosis.Emphysema.Heart failure.Lung cancer.Pneumonia.Respiratory trauma (rib fracture, collapsed lung, bruised lung).Sleep apnea.Using an oxygen tank also doesn\u2019t require you to have a condition that affects your breathing. Some people use oxygen tanks when they visit high-altitude areas. This includes athletes.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
