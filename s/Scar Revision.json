Most scars need 12 to 18 months to mature, as new scars don\u2019t usually respond well to scar revision.Scar revision techniques may include:Topical treatments.Injectables.Skin resurfacing.Surgery.AdvertisementHow do topical treatments reduce the appearance of scars?Your provider will apply topical treatments to the surface of your skin, so they don\u2019t require a needle or any type of incision (cut). Topicals tend to be more effective as a wound heals, or for mild, newly formed scars.Types of topical treatments include:Polyurethane dressing: A self-adhesive polyurethane bandage or pad can reduce a scar\u2019s hardness and size. It may also help the scar return to a normal color. Some people use this dressing with pressure therapy for better results.Pressure therapy: You use a bandage or wrap to apply pressure to a wound as it heals or to a newly formed scar on your body. Pressure therapy can help prevent scars and may reduce the appearance of raised scars.Silicone gel: You can apply flexible sheets coated with silicone gel to your wound or scar. This treatment may relieve redness, itching and irritation caused by the scar. It can also help prevent raised scars.Most people need to use topical treatments for 12 to 24 hours each day, sometimes, for several months.Some healthcare providers may recommend vitamin E or A as a cream, gel or oil to treat scars.

They may work on scars by preventing your skin from producing new tissue.Corticosteroid injections: These steroid injections work by reducing the formation of collagen in your skin, which can minimize the size, appearance and texture of a scar.Cryotherapy: A substance such as liquid nitrogen or argon gas freezes the scar tissue, eventually causing it to die. Cryotherapy is usually reserved for small scars.Dermal fillers: Fillers can help reduce the appearance of scars that go beneath the surface of your skin. They\u2019re most effective for acne scars and pockmarks (pitted scars that go beneath the surface of your skin). Examples of dermal fillers include Juv\u00e9derm\u00ae, Radiesse\u00ae and Restylane\u00ae.How do resurfacing treatments reduce the appearance of scars?Skin resurfacing treatments work by removing the top layers of your skin. They help reveal smoother, undamaged skin, which can improve the color and texture of scars.Types of resurfacing treatments include:Chemical peel: A healthcare provider applies a chemical solution (usually a type of acid) to your skin. Chemical peels are best for mild scars, usually on your face.Dermabrasion: Dermabrasion removes layers of skin by sanding it away with a brush or rough pad. It\u2019s for your face or body.Dermaplaning: A healthcare provider uses a special razor to shave away the upper layers of your skin. Dermaplaning can help improve the appearance of acne scars.Light or laser therapy: These treatments use light or heat to trigger skin cell turnover. Laser skin resurfacing can reduce irritation from scars and help scars return to a normal skin color.Skin bleaching: Substances that lighten the skin may reduce the appearance of scars.Microneedling: A healthcare provider uses a device to create microscopic punctures in your skin, which encourages remodeling and improves scar appearance.How does surgery reduce the appearance of scars?Sometimes, surgery is necessary for large, severe scars, especially if the scars are causing you pain or making it difficult to move. During surgery, a healthcare provider cuts the scar out of your skin and then closes the wound with stitches.Common scar revision surgeries include Z-plasty and W-plasty. A surgeon cuts the scarred skin into a \u201cZ\u201d or \u201cW\u201d formation, which gives that area of skin more movement once it heals.Some people need skin grafts if there isn\u2019t enough healthy skin to close the wound. A surgeon might use skin from another area of your body. Grafting is a common treatment for serious burn scars.Your healthcare provider might recommend injections or topical scar treatment to help a new surgical wound heal and reduce the risk of additional scarring.Care at Cleveland ClinicTreatment for ScarsFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of scar revision?Risks of scar revision depend on the type of treatment you receive.
