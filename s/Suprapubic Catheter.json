Many people think you can only use a catheter by inserting it into your urethra and guiding it up to your bladder (urethral catheter). But a suprapubic catheter accesses the bladder from a small cut (incision) in the lower part of your abdomen.Suprapubic catheters are generally safe and have a low risk of complications. Many people use them because they\u2019re more comfortable than urethral catheters. You may also need a suprapubic catheter because an injury to your urethra makes catheters that enter through your urethra difficult or impossible to use.Why would someone have a suprapubic catheter?Healthcare providers use suprapubic catheters to drain pee from your bladder when you can\u2019t pee on your own. The following conditions may cause problems peeing:Urinary incontinence.Pelvic organ prolapse.Prostate cancer.Prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia).Surgery on your prostate or genitals.Spinal cord injury.Lower body paralysis (paraplegia).Multiple sclerosis (MS).An epidural, which can cause you to temporarily lose control of your bladder.Parkinson\u2019s disease.Urethral stricture.Inability to pull back your foreskin (phimosis).Buried penis.Scarring.Are suprapubic catheters common?Healthcare providers don\u2019t use suprapubic catheters as often as urethral catheters. However, they may recommend a suprapubic catheter if you must use it long-term or if you\u2019re having urethral surgery.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens during suprapubic catheter placement?A healthcare provider may first take imaging tests (X-rays or ultrasound) around your bladder and the surrounding areas to make sure it\u2019s safe to place the suprapubic catheter \u2014 sometimes loops of your small intestine (small bowel) rest between your bladder and your abdominal wall.Then, they\u2019ll clean the skin of your lower abdomen where they\u2019ll make the incision with an antiseptic, like iodine or alcohol, to help prevent infection. They\u2019ll then apply a local anesthetic to numb the area so you won\u2019t feel much pain. In some cases, they may give you general anesthesia so you aren\u2019t awake.Once you\u2019re numb, they\u2019ll make a small cut on your skin and place the suprapubic catheter. Once it enters the bladder, pee will drain out of the catheter and into a collection bag. They\u2019ll use about one stitch to help keep the catheter in place. They\u2019ll put a bandage around your incision to help prevent an infection. The tip of the suprapubic catheter also contains a small balloon. They\u2019ll also inflate the balloon with sterile water to keep the catheter in place in your bladder.If you need to use a suprapubic catheter for a long time, the provider will teach you or a close friend or family member how to safely change it.How long does it take to place a suprapubic catheter?Suprapubic catheter placement is quick \u2014 it usually takes less than 20 minutes.How do I care for my suprapubic catheter?It\u2019s important to keep the area around your suprapubic catheter clean.
