PolicyWhat are sinus surgery types?There are several types of sinus surgeries:Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS): This is the most common type of sinus surgery. This surgery widens the drainage passages between your nose and your sinuses, removing bone or infected tissue so mucus trapped in your sinuses can get out. Healthcare providers use endoscopes to see inside of your nose and sinuses and guide the surgery. Endoscopes are thin tubes with lights on the end. Healthcare providers may use an image-guided system to do FESS. In image-guided surgery, healthcare providers use computed tomography (CT) scans to \u201csee\u201d the inside of your sinuses.Balloon sinuplasty: Balloon sinuplasty is a minimally invasive treatment for sinusitis. Healthcare providers use an endoscope and catheter to guide a small balloon into your nose. They inflate the balloon to increase the passageway to your sinuses.Caldwell Luc surgery:Healthcare providers may do this surgery when approaches that are more traditional haven\u2019t resolved your sinus issues. In this surgery, providers make a new opening from your maxillary sinus \u2014 the sinus cavity behind your cheek \u2014 to your nose so mucus can drain from your sinus cavities.What\u2019s the difference between sinus surgery and turbinate reduction?In sinus surgery, a healthcare provider opens blocked sinus passages. Turbinate reduction is surgery to reduce the size of your turbinates. These are small bony structures inside of your nose.Is sinus surgery serious surgery?In general, sinus surgeries aren\u2019t serious surgeries with significant complications.Is sinus surgery very painful?Healthcare providers use general or local anesthesia when they do sinus surgery. General anesthesia means you\u2019re unconscious and don\u2019t feel any pain. People who have local anesthesia may feel pressure during surgery but typically don\u2019t feel any pain. They may have mild to moderate pain for about a week after surgery.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before this procedure?Your healthcare provider will do a pre-operation screening to be sure you\u2019re able to have the surgery. They may prescribe medications that prevent infection or swelling. Every person\u2019s situation is different, but most healthcare providers recommend the following:If you smoke, please try to stop smoking at least three weeks before your surgery. Smoking can make your sinus symptoms worse. Ask your healthcare provider for advice or resources to help with this.Don\u2019t take aspirin for at least seven days before your surgery. Even small amounts of aspirin can increase how much you bleed during and after your surgery.If your surgery involves general anesthesia, don\u2019t eat or drink anything after midnight the day of your surgery.You won\u2019t be able to drive for 24 hours after your surgery, so plan to have someone available to help you get home.Your healthcare provider will administer general anesthesia just before your surgery begins.AdvertisementWhat happens during these surgeries?Healthcare providers do functional endoscopic sinus surgery and balloon sinuplasty by inserting surgical tools into your nose. Caldwell Luc surgery involves going through your mouth to reach a sinus cavity and open a passage between that sinus and your nose.Functional endoscopic sinus surgeryFESS is the standard procedure to treat serious sinus conditions. Here\u2019s an overview of the process:Your healthcare provider puts decongestant medication in your nose.They do a follow-up nasal endoscopy.They inject a numbing solution into your nose.Using the endoscope, they gently enter your nose. They insert surgical tools alongside the endoscope to use the endoscope to remove bone, diseased tissue or polyps that may be blocking your sinuses.They may also use a small rotating burr to scrape out tissue.Finally, your healthcare provider may pack your nose with material to absorb any blood or discharge.Balloon sinuplastyThis is an alternative to FESS. Here\u2019s information about this process:Your healthcare provider will inject local anesthetic into the tissue lining your nose.They\u2019ll insert a catheter into your nose, using an endoscope to guide the catheter.Then, they\u2019ll use the catheter to place a small balloon in your sinuses.They\u2019ll slowly inflate the balloon to unblock your sinuses.They\u2019ll remove the balloon.Caldwell Luc surgeryHealthcare providers typically do this surgery when other procedures haven\u2019t solved your sinus issues. In this surgery, providers open your maxillary sinus, which is located behind your cheek, and create a new path from your sinus to your nose. They typically remove any damaged tissue or bone as part of the surgery. Here\u2019s more information about this surgery:You\u2019ll receive general anesthesia.Your healthcare provider makes an incision in your gum between your upper lip and gum tissue to get to the wall of your maxillary sinus.They make a small hole in your sinus wall so they can remove any damaged or diseased bone or tissue.They use an endoscope to increase the size of your maxillary sinus opening.They use sutures (stitches) to close the gum incision.What happens after sinus surgery?If you received general anesthesia, you\u2019ll rest in a recovery room while your anesthesia wears off. If you had local anesthesia, you\u2019ll be able to go home right away. Before you leave, your provider will give you information about taking care of yourself as you recover. Your provider may prescribe pain medication to help with the mild or moderate pain you may have for a week or so after your surgery. They may also prescribe antibiotics to help prevent infection.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule Sinus SurgeryFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are sinus surgery risks or complications?Any surgery has potential complications, but sinus surgery complications are rare.
