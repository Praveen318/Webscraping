They can be benign (non-cancerous) tumors, low-grade malignant (cancerous) tumors that grow slowly, or high-grade tumors that grow aggressively. More than 90 percent of spine tumors are metastatic \u2014 they arise from cancers that begin in a different part of the body and can result in painful symptoms requiring invasive treatment procedures.Stereotactic spine radiosurgery can provide pain relief using a non-surgical, non-invasive procedure that delivers precise radiation to the tumor using a three-dimensional targeting system. This is often the treatment of choice for spine tumors, and can also be part of an integrated treatment plan.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the potential effects of spine tumors?If left untreated, spine tumors can destroy the bones of the spine, which leads to a loss of stability of the spinal column, and often compression of the spinal cord or nerves. This can cause disabling pain, injury to nerves or the spinal cord and ultimately paralysis.A new treatment optionEarly management is essential due to the serious consequences of spine tumors. Beyond analgesics (medications that reduce or eliminate pain), traditional options include surgery, conventional radiation therapy over days or weeks, and chemotherapy. Stereotactic spine radiosurgery can be used as a stand-alone procedure for spine tumors, or in conjunction with other treatments.Procedure DetailsHow does stereotactic spine radiosurgery work?Stereotactic spine radiosurgery uses technology that delivers a high dose of radiation to the tumor(s). SRS targets the tumor very precisely using narrow radiation beams, thereby ensuring the radiation dose to the tumor is maximized while minimizing exposure to nearby normal tissue. This highly selective radiation dose often results in effective pain and/or tumor control. The treatment can be as simple as one session given on an outpatient basis.AdvertisementWhat happens after the stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SRS) procedure?Following your stereotactic spine radiosurgery, an MRI scan and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled with your neurosurgeon or radiation oncologist. Routine follow-up appointments and regularly scheduled imaging studies may be necessary, depending on your condition.What are typical results after the stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SRS) procedure?The success rate depends on the type of tumor being treated. In general, 85 to 90 percent local pain relief can be achieved in patients within one month or less of treatment. Local tumor growth rates are normally between 80 and 90 percent.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of stereotactic spine radiosurgery?Stereotactic spine radiosurgery requires virtually no recovery time. It often results in rapid pain control that can significantly improve functionality.Stereotactic spine radiosurgery can be used for:Pain reliefFirst line of treatment for spine tumorsTreatment of residual tumor(s) after surgeryTumor recurrence following conventional treatment(s)Alternative option when other treatments haven\u2019t been successfulAdditional DetailsFrequently asked questions about the stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SRS) procedureWill the treatment hurt?
