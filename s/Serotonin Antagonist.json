The highest concentration is in your gastrointestinal system. Serotonin antagonists work to block the 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptors in your gastrointestinal (GI) system and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). The CTZ is an area of your medulla oblongata that plays a role in initiating vomiting.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that also acts as a hormone. About 90% of your serotonin is in the cells that line your gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin has several roles, including regulating your mood, digestion, sleep and more.Nausea happens when your body releases serotonin into your gut faster than it can digest it. Your brain then receives a chemical message, which you perceive as nausea.Serotonin antagonists fit into 5-HT3 receptors but don\u2019t activate them. Instead, they don\u2019t let serotonin act on the receptors. This can prevent or treat nausea.How long do I need to take a serotonin antagonist?It\u2019s easier to prevent nausea and vomiting than it is to stop them once they start. Because of this, healthcare providers usually have people who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy take serotonin antagonist medication on a strict schedule around the clock.Your provider will be able to give you more specific information and instructions.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the side effects of serotonin antagonists?Relatively common side effects of serotonin antagonists include:Headache.Fatigue.Constipation.How well do serotonin antagonists work?Serotonin antagonists generally work well to prevent nausea.
