Your surgeon performs the procedure through the mouth, using small instruments. So, no incisions are made on the outside of the body.

This allows more air to pass through to the trachea (windpipe).How long is supraglottoplasty surgery?Supraglottoplasty surgery can usually be completed in about one hour.
