PolicyProcedure DetailsHow does a splint work?A splint holds a part of your body part in one position. You might see this referred to as immobilization. It\u2019s made of a rigid material like metal or plastic. It also usually has a cushion of foam or padded fabric to prevent pressure sores while you\u2019re wearing it.A splint makes sure you don\u2019t put stress on the injury and that part of your body while you\u2019re healing. While you\u2019re wearing a splint, you might not be able to move or use your injured body part. This will help it heal. It\u2019ll also help reduce pain and inflammation.What are the types of splints?Healthcare providers use splints to immobilize parts of your body that need support after an injury, including your:Fingers.Wrists.Elbows and forearms.Knees.Ankles and feet.Your provider will tell you which type of splint you\u2019ll need. They\u2019ll tell you where you can buy one and show you how to use it. Splints are typically pre-made devices that aren\u2019t custom-fitted to your body. Your provider might recommend a custom-fitted splint, but it\u2019s less common.Providers in the emergency room (ER) may put you in a custom-made fiberglass splint as the first step to treating a bone fracture. You might need a custom splint right after a fracture if your provider needs to stabilize the injury long enough for swelling to go down before they surgically repair your bone or put you in a cast.The most common types of splints include:Static splints: The splint holds your body part completely still. You won\u2019t be able to move it at all while you\u2019re wearing the splint.Static progressive splints: The splint doesn\u2019t let you move, but it\u2019s adjustable. Your provider may adjust its position over time to stretch your body or change the splint\u2019s position while you heal.Dynamic splints: You can move your splinted body part, but only a specific amount your provider sets. Your provider may adjust how far you can move in your splint (your range of motion) over time.Serial static splints: These hold your body part at the furthest point of its range of motion. Providers use these to make sure tissue around an injury stays stretched and flexible while the injury heals.You can buy splints over the counter (OTC) at pharmacies or retail stores. They can be adjusted or removed (if your provider says it\u2019s safe).Risks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of wearing a splint?Splints are easier to apply and remove than other forms of immobilization (like casts). They\u2019re also adjustable, usually with Velcro\u00ae, fabric straps or tape. This is especially helpful if you\u2019re experiencing swelling right after an injury.They\u2019re usually smaller and take up less space than casts, which should make it slightly easier to go through your daily routine. If your provider says it\u2019s safe, you can remove a splint when you\u2019re showering or bathing.Wear your splint as often as your provider suggests. This will help your injuries heal correctly.
