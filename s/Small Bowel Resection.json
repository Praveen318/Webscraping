The procedure is also known as a small intestine resection. Some surgeries remove a small part, while other resections are more extensive sections.Your small bowel is 20 to 30 feet long.

For example, people with Crohn\u2019s disease complications may need an ileocecal resection.This procedure may remove part of your:Ileum, the last and longest section of your small intestine, which ends at your large intestine.Cecum, the junction between your small and large intestine.Appendix, the small tube that sticks out from your large intestine.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat type of surgeon performs a small bowel resection?Depending on why you need a resection, a general or colorectal surgeon may perform the procedure.General surgeons often perform resections, making them a safe choice for people with a variety of needs. These include emergency surgery for intestinal obstructions, traumatic injuries and hernias.Colorectal surgeons care for people with rare and complex conditions. People with congenital disorders or advanced GI disease may be better served by this specialist.What are the different procedure options?Many surgical techniques are available:Laparoscopic surgery involves small incisions through which your surgeon passes thin tubes with instruments and a camera at the tip.Robotic surgery enables surgeons to safely carry out procedures in hard-to-reach areas. Your surgeon uses robotic technology to enhance the reach and precision of their hands.Open surgery uses one large incision in the mid-abdomen to access your small bowel. This approach may be necessary if you aren\u2019t eligible for a robotic or laparoscopic procedure.What happens before a small bowel resection?If it isn\u2019t an emergency, preparing for small bowel resection surgery includes labs and imaging studies to ensure you\u2019re healthy enough for the procedure. You\u2019ll need to stop certain daily medications, like blood thinners, aspirin or anti-inflammatories.In the days leading up to surgery, you\u2019ll also need to clear your bowels. This starts with eating high-fiber foods and drinking plenty of water to encourage bowel movements. As the procedure gets closer, you\u2019ll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. You may also need an enema or laxatives.What happens during small bowel resection surgery?Here\u2019s what to expect during your procedure:You receive general anesthesia medications that put you to sleep and temporarily block sensation.If it\u2019s a laparoscopic or robotic procedure, your surgeon makes one or more small incisions. For an open procedure, your surgeon makes one large incision.Your surgeon accesses the affected section of your small bowel.They put clamps on either side of the diseased tissue and then remove it.For an obstruction, blood vessel repair (revascularization) may be necessary to restore blood flow to your intestines.When the procedure is complete, your surgeon closes the incision and places a dressing over it.What happens after my surgeon removes the dead tissue?The next steps of your procedure may include:Anastomosis: Connecting the healthy ends of intestinal tissue with either sutures or staples.Ileostomy: If there isn\u2019t enough tissue to connect the ends, your surgeon creates an opening on the external surface of your abdomen. Your small intestine empties through this hole and into a special bag that attaches to your skin.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule General SurgeryFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of a small bowel resection?Resection surgery may prevent severe gastrointestinal issues from worsening. This can help you avoid more extensive treatments like a larger resection. Preserving as much intestinal tissue as possible can help you avoid life-altering complications like short bowel syndrome.What are the side effects of small bowel resection surgery?The procedure has many risks, including:Anastomotic leak, when stitches or staples securing the remaining tissue come loose. This is a life-threatening condition.Chronic anemia.Damage to nearby organs, such as your liver or pancreas.Diarrhea that lasts a few weeks.Hernia, when intestinal tissue bulges through the incision.Stricture.Small bowel obstructions.Why might I have diarrhea after a small bowel resection?Intestinal tissue is very delicate. Significant changes, like removing tissue, disrupt nerves and muscles that help it function. Your body may move nutrients along faster than usual. Or your intestines may need time to adjust the digestive process to bowels that are now shorter.Recovery and OutlookWhat can I expect after a small bowel resection?You\u2019ll stay in the hospital for a few days. At the start of your recovery, the intestines will need to rest, so you won\u2019t be able to consume food by mouth. Instead, you receive nutrients through tube feeding (enteral nutrition). As you start feeling better, you can consume fluids and soft foods by mouth.After discharge, you should continue resting for a few days. It\u2019s essential to get out of bed periodically and walk to prevent blood clots. Care may also include follow-up appointments with your surgeon to ensure your recovery is on track.How long does it take to recover from a small bowel resection?Recovery typically takes a few months. However, most people feel well enough to resume daily activities within a few weeks.What is the prognosis after a small bowel resection?A resection provides long-lasting relief. For traumatic injuries and congenital conditions, the procedure can be curative. But it isn\u2019t always a permanent fix. Conditions like hernias and Crohn\u2019s disease can come back, sometimes requiring an additional resection.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I contact my healthcare provider after small bowel resection surgery?Contact your healthcare provider if you experience:Difficulty having a bowel movement.Frequent nausea and vomiting that make it difficult to keep food or fluids down.Oozing of pus or blood from the incision.Pain that doesn\u2019t get better with medications.Signs of infection, like fever or skin near the incision that\u2019s warm to the touch.A note from Cleveland ClinicSmall bowel resection is a surgery that removes the damaged or diseased portion of your small bowel (intestine). It may be an open, robotic, or laparoscopic procedure. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary to remove or repair tissue from nearby organs, as well. Although it might be hard to imagine life without a section of your small bowel, it\u2019s 20 to 30 feet long. Once your body adjusts, it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t miss it.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 01/10/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
