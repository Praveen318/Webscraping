These teeth often have deep pits and grooves where food and bacteria become trapped.What are dental sealants?Sealants are thin, liquid coatings painted onto the chewing surfaces of your back teeth (premolars and molars). Once applied, a dentist cures and hardens the sealant material to shield and protect your teeth from harmful cavity-causing bacteria.What are dental sealants made of?Manufacturers use a couple different materials to make sealants, including medical-grade:Resins (plant or synthetic).Glass ionomers (glass powder combined with a water-soluble acid).What is the purpose of sealants?Dentists place sealants to protect your teeth from disease-causing bacteria. Your back teeth have deep grooves that help you grind up food when you chew. Food and bacteria can become trapped in these grooves, leading to tooth decay (cavities) over time. Sealants coat these areas so bacteria can\u2019t reach them.Who needs dental sealants?Children and teenagers are popular candidates for dental sealants. But adults without decay or dental fillings in their molars can also benefit from this treatment. In general, anyone who\u2019s prone to tooth decay on their back teeth should consider sealants.Typically, children should get sealants on their permanent molars and premolars as soon as these teeth come in. This way, the dental sealants can protect their teeth through the cavity-prone years (ages 6 through 14).In some cases, dental sealants may also be appropriate for primary (baby) teeth. For example, if your child has baby teeth with deep depressions and grooves, sealants can protect these areas. Because baby teeth play such an important role in holding space for adult (permanent) teeth, it\u2019s important to keep these teeth healthy so they\u2019re not lost too early.How common are sealants?Sealants are one of the most common preventive dentistry treatments performed today. In the U.S., approximately 42% of children aged 6 to 11 and 48% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 have dental sealants on their adult (permanent) teeth.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Children aged 6 to 11 who don\u2019t have dental sealants are three times more likely to develop tooth decay. In many cases, dental sealants are an excellent investment. They\u2019re less costly than other treatments, and they reduce your chances of needing more invasive dental work in the future.But sealants aren\u2019t for everyone. People with partially erupted (grown-in) teeth won\u2019t benefit from sealants. Dentists also won\u2019t place sealants on teeth that have fillings or crowns. In these cases, sealants aren\u2019t only unnecessary, but they\u2019re also unhelpful.To learn more about sealants and whether they\u2019re right for you or your child, talk to your dentist or hygienist.A note from Cleveland ClinicDental sealants are a lot like raincoats for your teeth. In the same way a raincoat shields you from the elements, sealants shield your teeth from disease-causing bacteria. Sealants aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can significantly reduce your risk for cavities, giving you the best chance for healthy teeth and gums.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 03/27/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
