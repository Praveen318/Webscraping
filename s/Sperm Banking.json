Your testes (testicles) produce sperm. When you ejaculate during orgasm, you release approximately 300 million sperm cells in your semen. Semen is the whitish-gray fluid that releases from your penis when you orgasm.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

You may want to use your sperm to have children in the future. However, your current situation or circumstances may not allow you to have a baby through sex (intercourse). Situations or circumstances may include:Health conditions. Testicular cancer, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and leukemia have high risks of causing male infertility.Certain treatments. Some treatments may prevent you from achieving pregnancy (infertility). These may include chemotherapy, orchiectomy or gender affirmation surgery. After these treatments, your sperm cell numbers may decrease significantly, or you may no longer be able to make sperm.Age. Most men and people AMAB make millions of new sperm cells each day. However, as you age, the quality of your sperm may decrease. This generally occurs in men aged 40 and older.Low sperm count. You may have a low sperm count if you\u2019re younger than 40. Even banking a low number of quality sperm can help you have children through assisted reproductive procedures. One effective procedure in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).Frequent traveling. Many people travel a lot for work. The best time for women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB) to get pregnant is during their fertile window (five days before ovulation up to one day after ovulation). If your partner ovulates while one of you is traveling, they may use your frozen sperm to become pregnant.Military deployment. Dangerous military employment may result in injuries to your reproductive organs.Vasectomy. Many people choose to have a vasectomy as a form of birth control. However, they may change their minds as they get older and wish to have children.If you\u2019re married or in a committed relationship, it\u2019s best if your partner is involved in your decision. If you\u2019re younger than 18, you should discuss your thoughts with your parents, guardians or caregivers.When should I start banking my sperm?You may have to decide to bank your sperm quickly, especially if you have a serious illness. It\u2019s a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider about banking your sperm before starting treatment.It\u2019s usually safe to collect sperm samples during your first week of chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Chemotherapy and radiation may damage the genetic material in your developing sperm, but your mature sperm are resistant to damage.AdvertisementWill banking sperm delay my medical treatment?No, banking your sperm won\u2019t delay the start of your medical treatment.Your testicles constantly produce sperm. However, it takes time to build up (replenish) your sperm cell levels after each ejaculation. It\u2019s best to collect a sample at least 48 hours after your last sexual activity (masturbation or intercourse) to have the greatest sperm cell level.You may have to collect several samples. Your healthcare provider will collect other samples after another 48 hours of abstinence. However, if your treatment schedule doesn\u2019t allow that much time, waiting 24 hours between collections is often enough.How common is sperm banking?Sperm banking is common. Healthcare providers first preserved semen in dry ice in 1953 and later used it to conceive a human baby. They used liquid nitrogen to preserve semen samples starting in 1963.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before sperm banking?Before you bank your sperm, your healthcare provider will test you for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV and AIDS. They\u2019ll likely use a blood test.During a blood test, your healthcare provider will use a thin needle (21 gauge, slightly smaller than a standard earring) to withdraw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. It\u2019s not usually painful, but you\u2019ll feel a slight pinch as the needle goes through your skin.After your healthcare provider has taken your blood sample, they\u2019ll send it to a laboratory (lab) for testing. Lab technicians will then examine your blood for the presence of any STIs.What happens during sperm banking?During sperm banking, you\u2019ll go to a special healthcare facility called a fertility clinic. A healthcare provider will lead you to a private room and give you a special container.The container is usually a small plastic jar with a screw-top lid. Some fertility clinics also offer collection condoms. Collection condoms are different than over-the-counter (OTC) condoms. OTC condoms can damage your sperm. Many also contain lubricants that kill sperm cells (spermicide).In the privacy of the room, you\u2019ll masturbate and use the special container to collect your semen.Lubricants, including saliva, may damage or slow down your sperm. If you require a lubricant, your healthcare provider can provide an approved lubricant that\u2019s safe for sperm.Some people may require the use of a masturbation aid (sex toy). If you wish to use a sex toy, talk to your healthcare provider to ensure it won\u2019t damage your sperm or limit your sample.Masturbation is a private act. Some people have difficulty providing a semen sample outside of the comfort of their homes. If you\u2019re not comfortable or can\u2019t masturbate at a fertility clinic, you may be able to use a home sperm-banking kit. Your healthcare provider can discreetly mail a sperm-banking kit to your home along with detailed instructions for collecting and returning the sample for storage.If you provide a semen sample at home, you may have to drop your semen off at the fertility clinic within a few hours. You may also have to keep it as close to your body temperature as possible to ensure your sperm\u2019s health.What happens after sperm banking?After you\u2019ve collected your semen sample and given it to your healthcare provider, they\u2019ll carefully label and code your sample with:Your name.Your patient identification (ID) number.An internal control number (an additional unique number that ensures proper identification).The date.The fertility clinic may copy your photo ID for your permanent file as an additional safety measure.This information ensures accurate identification and confidentiality at the time of storage, during storage and at the time of release.Your healthcare provider will collect a small amount of your semen sample for testing. They\u2019ll divide the rest of your sample into small amounts, treat them with a special chemical that protects your sperm during the freezing process (cryopreservative) and store them in special containers called cryovials.The freezing process starts right away. Your healthcare provider will place the samples in a freezer set to -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 degrees Celsius). This step prevents your sperm from dying due to an extreme drop in temperature.Your healthcare provider then puts your samples in a liquid nitrogen vapor that\u2019s -86 degrees Fahrenheit (-66 degrees Celsius) for approximately two hours.Finally, your healthcare provider will permanently store your samples in a deep-freeze storage tank that contains liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen is -321 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 degrees Celsius).What tests are done on my sperm?Your healthcare provider will analyze a small amount of your semen sample before freezing it. They\u2019ll examine:The total number of sperm cells.The total number of live sperm.The percentage of sperm that are moving (motility).Between 24 and 48 hours after your healthcare provider freezes your semen sample, they\u2019ll analyze a small amount to measure the percentage of sperm that survive the freezing process. In general, sperm from a high-quality semen sample has a better recovery rate after thawing.Based on the test results before and after freezing, your healthcare provider can recommend the optimal number of semen samples to ensure the best chance of pregnancy. They can also advise whether intrauterine insemination (artificial insemination) or in vitro fertilization is your best treatment option.How can I withdraw my semen sample?Notify your fertility clinic at least four weeks before you\u2019re ready to use it for fertility treatment. You or your legally appointed executor must then fill out a release form.Care at Cleveland ClinicMale Infertility TreatmentFind A Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of sperm banking?There are many advantages to banking your sperm, including:Fertility.

Sperm retrieval surgeries include:Microscopic testicular sperm extraction (microTESE).Needle aspiration biopsy (NAB).Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA).CostThe cost of cryopreserving one semen sample is usually around $1,000.
