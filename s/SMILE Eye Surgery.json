Its name gives an idea of what happens. The laser creates a lenticule and a tiny incision \u2014 less than 4 millimeters long \u2014 into your eye to remove your lenticule.

Removing the piece of tissue is what changes the shape of your cornea.What does SMILE eye surgery treat?Your eye care professional may suggest SMILE surgery if you have refractive errors and want to be able to see without using eyeglasses or contact lenses.They may recommend SMILE eye surgery over other types of corrective surgeries if you have a higher prescription or issues with dry eyes.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow should I prepare for SMILE eye surgery?In a pre-surgery appointment, your surgeon will examine your eyes to confirm you don\u2019t have any other eye diseases or conditions that mean you shouldn\u2019t have SMILE surgery.
