PolicySliding genioplasty vs. chin implant: What\u2019s the difference?A sliding genioplasty and a chin implant are types of genioplasty (chin augmentation). They can both improve the look of your chin and help your chin and jawline appear more balanced with the rest of your facial features. The two procedures have important differences:Sliding genioplasty: A sliding genioplasty uses your existing chin bone to reshape a protruding, recessed or misaligned chin.Chin implant: Chin implant surgery uses a flexible piece of silicone to enhance a small chin and add definition to your lower face and jawline.Who gets a sliding genioplasty?Most people get a sliding genioplasty for cosmetic reasons. However, some people may need the procedure to reconstruct their chin and jawline. Reconstructive surgery might be necessary after an injury, such as a facial fracture, or if you have a congenital condition (birth defect).The most common reasons for a sliding genioplasty include:Chin asymmetry (crooked chin that doesn\u2019t line up with the middle of your face).Chin length abnormalities (long or short chin).Macrogenia (large chin).Microgenia (small chin).Prognathia (chin protrudes too far forward).Retrogenia (chin sits too far back).Retrognathia (jaw is set too far back).The ideal candidate for a sliding genioplasty is someone who:Doesn\u2019t have a jaw disorder.Doesn\u2019t smoke.Has reached full skeletal maturity (bone growth is complete; late teen years).Has realistic expectations about the results of chin surgery.Is healthy.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow can I prepare for a sliding genioplasty?Your healthcare provider will give you instructions on how to prepare for your sliding genioplasty. They may:Ask you to quit smoking several weeks before the procedure.Do imaging scans of your chin and jaw to plan the surgery.Perform a physical exam or blood work to make sure you\u2019re in good health.Recommend you stop taking certain medications such as aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs or herbal supplements.Start you on a course of antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection.What happens during a sliding genioplasty?Before your chin surgery, you receive anesthesia. Most people get general anesthesia, which means you\u2019re unconscious during the procedure.During the procedure, a surgeon pulls down your lower lip and makes a horizontal incision (cut) at the base of your jaw line. As the incision scar will be inside of your mouth, it won\u2019t be visible. Your surgeon uses a surgical saw to cut away part of your chin bone. Providers call this part of the procedure an osteotomy.Depending on the specific type of chin realignment you need, your surgeon may move the cut bone forward, backward or sideways. To shorten a long chin, your surgeon removes the piece of cut bone. To lengthen a short chin, your surgeon may leave a space between two pieces of your chin bone. New bone eventually grows to fill the space.Your surgeon may use special tools to reshape your chin so it fits naturally with the rest of your facial features. They secure the cut bone to your chin using wire, plates or screws. Your surgeon closes the incision inside of your mouth with dissolvable stitches. They apply a tape-like surgical dressing, or bandage, along the incision inside of your mouth. You might also have a supportive dressing outside of your mouth, just below your lower lip and under your chin.AdvertisementWhat happens after a sliding genioplasty?You may be able to return home the day of your surgery. Some people stay overnight in the hospital. Your surgeon will give you specific instructions about how to care for your incision. It\u2019s important not to disturb the surgical dressings or the stitches inside of your mouth. Your surgeon removes the dressings three to four days after the procedure. The stitches dissolve in a few weeks.Care at Cleveland ClinicPlastic Surgery CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of a sliding genioplasty?Potential risks of a sliding genioplasty include:Bleeding.Bruising.Infection.Scarring.Tingling or numbness in your chin or lower lip.What are the benefits of a sliding genioplasty?A sliding genioplasty can improve the balance and symmetry of your facial features.
