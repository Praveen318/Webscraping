SLAP stands for Superior Labrum, Anterior to Posterior.The L in SLAP refers to your glenoid labrum. Your labrum cushions the top part of your upper arm bone, or humerus. This cushion helps your upper arm bone stay in place in your shoulder socket. Your labrum is also a connection point between your shoulder blade socket and one of your bicep tendons.The S in SLAP refers to the top of your labrum. When this part of your labrum tears, your upper arm bone loses its cushion, and your bicep tendon loses its connection to your shoulder blade socket. As a result, your shoulder hurts and feels unstable.SLAP tear surgery mends the tear in your labrum.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
