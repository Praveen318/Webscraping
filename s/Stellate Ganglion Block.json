These nerves are located in your neck, on both sides of your voice box. The injection can help relieve pain in your head, neck, upper arm and upper chest. It also can help increase circulation and blood flow to your arm.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyWhat is the stellate ganglion?The stellate ganglion is a bundle of sympathetic nerves located in the front of your neck near your first ribs (these ribs are right underneath your collarbones). You have one on each side of your neck. A ganglion is a collection of nerves. The stellate ganglion is shaped like an oval but may also look like a star (\u201cstellate\u201d means \u201cstar\u201d).The stellate ganglion provides most of the sympathetic nerve signals to your head, neck, arms and a portion of your upper chest. Your sympathetic nervous system is part of your autonomic nervous system. It\u2019s responsible for many functions your body controls without you thinking about them. This can include control of your heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and other functions.Does everyone have a stellate ganglion?To have a stellate ganglion, two ganglia (more than one ganglion) have to fuse together. The two that need to fuse are the inferior cervical ganglion and first thoracic ganglion. Inferior here means \u201cunderneath.\u201d The inferior cervical ganglion passes underneath the last vertebra of the cervical (neck) section of your spine. The first thoracic ganglion exits your spine at the same level as the first thoracic vertebra. That\u2019s the topmost vertebra in the thoracic (upper back) section of your spine.Only 80% of people worldwide have a stellate ganglion. In everyone else, these ganglia don\u2019t fuse in the usual manner.What are stellate ganglion blocks used for?Healthcare providers use stellate ganglion blocks to diagnose sympathetically mediated pain (SMP). This is a chronic neuropathic pain condition that happens when your sympathetic nervous system sends pain signals to your brain for unknown reasons.Providers also use the injections to treat circulation problems, pain symptoms and conditions or nerve injuries, including:Complex regional pain syndrome type I (formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy) or type II (formerly known as causalgia).Peripheral vascular (artery) disease.Phantom limb pain.Postherpetic neuralgia.Chronic post-surgical pain.Hyperhidrosis.Raynaud\u2019s syndrome.Scleroderma.Cluster headaches.Orofacial pain (pain perceived in your face and/or mouth).Atypical chest pain.M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease.Intractable angina.Refractory cardiac arrhythmias.Stellate ganglion block for PTSD and other mental health conditionsResearchers have been studying the use of stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since 1990. The research has yielded mixed evidence \u2014 some people experience an improvement in their PTSD symptoms, while others have no changes.Researchers think the reason SGBs may help PTSD is due to a decrease in nerve growth factor levels. This reduces norepinephrine levels and increased sympathetic nervous system activity that happens with PTSD.U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved SGBs for the treatment of PTSD. But some healthcare providers may use them \u201coff-label\u201d for PTSD \u2014 typically only if other treatments aren\u2019t working.More recently, researchers have been studying the use of SGBs for other mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety and psychosis.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens during a stellate ganglion block injection?In general, you can expect the following during a stellate ganglion block injection:A provider may give you an IV medication to help you relax.You\u2019ll lie on your back on a procedure table in your provider\u2019s office, and a provider will clean and disinfect your neck.They\u2019ll use a thin needle to inject a local anesthetic into your neck near your voice box.With ultrasound or fluoroscopic imaging guidance, your provider will insert a second needle and carefully inject an anesthetic medication.Usually, the procedure takes less than 30 minutes.What happens after a stellate ganglion block?After the procedure, you\u2019ll stay in a recovery room where a healthcare professional will carefully monitor you for any complications \u2014 usually for about 40 to 60 minutes. Your provider will give you instructions for care at home. You\u2019ll need someone else to drive you home.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsHow successful are stellate ganglion blocks?Some people report pain relief immediately after the injection, but the pain may return a few hours later as the local anesthetic wears off. Other people have longer-term relief that helps them to reduce their medication use and increase their participation in physical therapy.How long does a stellate ganglion nerve block last?How long the pain relief lasts is different for each person. Some may be pain-free for days or weeks. Usually, people need a series of injections to continue the pain relief. Sometimes, it takes only two injections; sometimes, it takes more than 10. The relief tends to last longer with each treatment.What are the risks of a stellate ganglion block?Side effects of the procedure may include:Bruising or soreness at the injection site.Drooping eyelids.Red or \u201cbloodshot\u201d eyes.Watery eyes.Nasal stuffiness.Hoarse voice.Feeling of a lump in your throat.Difficulty swallowing.Warmth or tingling in your arm or hand.These effects usually go away within a few hours.Serious complications are rare but can include:Infection.Bleeding from a vascular puncture (from your carotid artery, internal jugular vein, inferior thyroid artery or vertebral artery).Nerve damage to your vagus nerve, recurrent nerve or brachial plexus roots.Pneumothorax.Thyroid injury.Esophageal and tracheal puncture.Transient Horner\u2019s syndrome.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any new symptoms or complications from the stellate ganglion block, such as an infection or prolonged difficulty with swallowing.A note from Cleveland ClinicStellate ganglion blocks can help treat a variety of pain and circulation conditions. But the results can vary considerably from person to person.
