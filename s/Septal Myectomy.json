During the procedure, your surgeon removes a portion of thickened heart tissue. This allows blood to flow through your heart more easily.How does hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affect my heart?Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes it more difficult for your heart to circulate blood through your body.Your heart has four chambers:Left and right chambers on the top (atria).Left and right chambers on the bottom (ventricles).A band of muscle called the septum separates your two ventricles. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum thickens and may bulge into your left heart ventricle. This bulging blocks blood flow, meaning your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be a congenital heart disease, meaning you\u2019re born with it.
