As the name suggests, you perform the procedure yourself.Self-catheterization, also called clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) or intermittent self -catheterization (ISC), involves inserting a thin, hollow tube called a catheter into the bladder through the urethra (the tube from which the urine exits your body). Urine drains out of the catheter into a toilet or container. When your bladder is empty, you slip out (remove) the catheter. You repeat these steps at regular intervals (intermittently) several times a day.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the types of urinary catheterization?There are several ways to use a catheter to empty the bladder:Indwelling: A sterile tube called a Foley catheter stays in the bladder. The tube is inserted through the urethra, or in some cases directly into the bladder from the lower abdomen (supra-pubic catheter). The catheter attaches to a drainage bag that collects urine throughout the day and night. A balloon in the tip of the catheter keeps the catheter from slipping out of the bladder. Depending on your mobility and situation, the drainage bag may attach to a bed, your leg, or clothes.Condom: Males can slip a condom-like device over the penis. The device has a tube that drains urine into a bag.Self (clean intermittent): You or a caregiver insert a catheter into the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day. Urine drains through the catheter into a toilet, collection bag or container.Who might need self-catheterization?Certain health problems can make it difficult to empty your bladder. Bladder control issues that could require a catheter are more likely if you have:Bladder surgery.Central nervous system tumors (astrocytoma).Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia).Multiple sclerosis (MS).Neurogenic bladder caused by cerebral palsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, spina bifida or spinal cord injuries.Stroke.Urinary incontinence, urinary retention or urethral strictures, and urinary fistulas.Severe constipation.Procedure DetailsHow should I prepare for self-catheterization?Your healthcare provider will show you how to perform self-catheterization.
