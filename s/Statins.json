PolicyWhat do statins do?Statins decrease your LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or bad cholesterol and may increase your HDL (high-density lipoprotein) or good cholesterol. LDL is bad because it builds up inside your arteries. HDL is good because it brings cholesterol to your liver, which gets it out of your body.How do statins work?Statins get in the way when your liver is trying to make cholesterol. Like a good basketball player who doesn\u2019t let an opponent get the ball, statins don\u2019t let your liver have an enzyme it needs to create cholesterol. Your body makes 75% of your cholesterol, so helping it make less can make a big difference. The rest of your body\u2019s cholesterol is from what you\u2019re eating.Statins also help your liver get rid of more cholesterol.AdvertisementWhy do I have high cholesterol if I eat healthy foods?You can get genes from your parents that tell your body to make more cholesterol than you need or not to absorb the cholesterol it needs.Who needs to take statins?Your healthcare provider will look at your individual situation when deciding if you should take a statin. Having diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol and using tobacco products are all risk factors for getting heart disease. Your provider will also consider your age, sex and race when deciding if you need a statin.Providers prescribe statins for people who:Have high cholesterol (LDL above 190 mg/dL) that exercise and diet changes couldn\u2019t reduce.Had a stroke, heart attack or peripheral artery disease.Have diabetes and an LDL of at least 70 mg/dL and are 40 to 75 years old.Have an LDL of at least 70 mg/dL and a high risk of getting heart disease and are 40 to 75 years old.AdvertisementWhy are statins used?Statins bring down your cholesterol level to make you less likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Your body uses cholesterol when it makes vitamin D, hormones and the acid you use to digest food. But if you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can collect inside your arteries. This creates obstacles that make it harder for your blood to get through your blood vessels.If cholesterol keeps building up in your arteries, it can do more than just make them narrow. The plaque (obstacles) in your blood vessels can become unstable and break open, leading to a heart attack.How common are statins?Statins are the most common drug class of prescriptions in America. More than 40 million adults take them.Risks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of statins?Statins decrease your risk of having a stroke or heart attack because they cut down the amount of bad cholesterol in your blood. That cholesterol can make your arteries narrow (atherosclerosis), making it hard for your blood to circulate and putting you at risk for a heart attack or stroke.What are the side effects of statins?Statins may cause mild side effects, including:Headache.Nausea.Dizziness.Gas.Diarrhea.Constipation.Achy muscles or joints.Rarely, statins may cause bad side effects, including:Confusion.Memory loss.Damage to your kidneys.Damage to your liver.Bad problems with your muscles.Type 2 diabetes or high blood sugar.Adults and teens can take statins. Most people don\u2019t have side effects from statins, but you shouldn\u2019t take them if you\u2019re pregnant, nursing or have certain types of liver disease. Let your provider know if you have diabetes. If you\u2019re already at risk for diabetes, statins can add to your risk of getting it.Some people have an interaction with another medicine while taking statins. Whenever your provider considers prescribing medication for you, it\u2019s important to tell them what else you\u2019re taking. That includes other prescription drugs, medicines you buy without a prescription, vitamins, herbs, supplements and recreational drugs.If one type of statin gives you side effects, ask your provider if they can switch you to a different one. You may also want to ask your provider if you need to avoid grapefruit or pomegranate or their juices or if it\u2019s ok to have a small amount. These foods can make it hard for your body to break some statins down, allowing too much of the drug to accumulate in your body and giving you more side effects.Recovery and OutlookWhat happens if you stop taking statins?Your cholesterol level will go back up if you stop taking statins. You\u2019ll probably need to keep taking them for years to come.What happens if I keep taking statins?Your total cholesterol and LDL (bad cholesterol) numbers should come down, as well as your risk for heart attack and stroke.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?While you\u2019re taking statins, you should contact your provider if your muscles or joints hurt or if you feel weak, have a fever or your urine is dark.A note from Cleveland ClinicStatins can help you reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke, but they aren\u2019t a cure for high cholesterol. You should keep exercising and eating healthy even if you\u2019re taking statins. And have your cholesterol checked regularly so you\u2019ll know if the statin is managing it well.Care at Cleveland ClinicCardiology CareMake an AppointmentMedically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 01/14/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
