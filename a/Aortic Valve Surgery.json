Treating aortic valve disease allows your heart to pump blood out to your body more efficiently.What is aortic valve surgery?Aortic valve surgery is a treatment for aortic valve disease. It involves repairing or replacing your aortic valve. This \u201cdoor\u201d manages blood flow from your heart\u2019s main pumping chamber (left ventricle) into your main artery (aorta).Aortic valve disease prevents your aortic valve from working as it should. Your valve opening may be too narrow, which limits how much blood can flow through. Or, your valve may be leaky, which means some blood flows backward each time your valve closes. Some people are born with congenital heart defects that may affect valve function.Aortic valve surgery can address these issues and lower your risk of complications of valve disease. These include heart failure and cardiac arrest.What does aortic valve surgery treat?Cardiac surgeons perform aortic valve surgery to treat:Aortic valve regurgitation (leaky valve).Aortic valve stenosis (narrowed valve opening).Nonsurgical treatments like medications may help manage your aortic valve disease for a long time. However, you may need surgery if you have symptoms, evidence of heart damage or heart failure.Types of aortic valve surgeryThere are two main types of aortic valve surgery:Aortic valve repair. Your surgeon fixes damaged parts of your valve while keeping as much of the natural tissue as possible.Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Your surgeon removes your damaged valve and puts a new one in its place. SAVR is an option for some people who aren\u2019t candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR/TAVI).Many factors determine the type of surgery you need, including:The results of your diagnostic tests.Your age.The structure of your heart.The presence of other medical conditions.Your surgeon will talk to you about your options and explain the most appropriate treatment plan for you.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
