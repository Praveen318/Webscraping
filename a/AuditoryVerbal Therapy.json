Even if your child\u2019s hearing loss is severe to profound, their therapist may be able to teach them how to listen and communicate through spoken language. Parents and other caregivers actively take part in the therapy lessons and continue the activities at home.The goal of auditory-verbal therapy (AVT) is for your child who is deaf or hard of hearing to learn, listen and have the same ability to speak like children who can hear. Children who go through auditory-verbal therapy generally succeed in mainstream education. They excel in math and reading, make friends, gain self-esteem and live with independence.While hearing aids and cochlear implants help your child hear sounds, they must still learn how to interpret those signals.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Is it successful?Hearing impairment is the most common congenital condition, meaning born with. But just because there\u2019s a hearing difference, that doesn\u2019t mean your child can\u2019t learn to hear. In fact, children with hearing aids or cochlear implants can often achieve impressive audibility.Experts have found that by the time they go to first grade, the majority of children who are deaf and hard of hearing, who go through auditory-verbal therapy, have similar \u2014 or even better \u2014 spoken language skills than their hearing peers. Studies have also shown that these children do better in school than those who have hearing loss but don\u2019t take part in AVT.Who can take part in auditory-verbal therapy?Auditory-verbal therapy (AVT) is most successful when children start early \u2014 as young as two to three months old. If your young child is deaf or hard of hearing, and they\u2019re using either hearing aids and/or cochlear implants, they may benefit from auditory-verbal therapy. Make sure that your newborn goes through the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS). If needed, babies can be fitted with hearing aids. If hearing aids aren\u2019t sufficient, your child can be evaluated for cochlear implants as early as nine months of age.It doesn\u2019t matter if your child was born deaf or hard of hearing or if something else caused their hearing difference. They may benefit from auditory-verbal therapy if they struggle to hear out of one ear or two, if their condition is permanent or temporary, or if their hearing loss is mild up through severe/profound.Take part in the therapy session with your child. Your healthcare provider will coach you along the way. It\u2019s helpful if you learn like they do. Then your \u201cjob\u201d will be to continue teaching them outside of the lessons with their clinician.AdvertisementWhat are hearing aids? What are cochlear implants?Hearing aids make speech and other sounds louder. Some people hear certain frequencies better than others, and their hearing aids can be customized to help. But just because your child hears you louder, that doesn\u2019t automatically result in comprehension. Auditory-verbal therapy (AVT) can help.If hearing aids aren\u2019t sufficient for your child, their healthcare provider may recommend cochlear implants. Inside of your inner ear is a hollow bone called the cochlea. When it works correctly, your inner ear transforms sound waves into electrical impulses that your brain understands. If your inner ear needs help, a surgeon can fit an implant within your cochlea. The device bypasses the damage and can provide your child with access to sound.Your child must typically be fitted with hearing aids and/or cochlear implants to take part in auditory-verbal therapy.How common is auditory-verbal therapy?Auditory-verbal therapy is relatively new. In 2022, there are just over 1,000 certified listening and spoken language specialists in the world. It\u2019s often difficult to find one in your area.AdvertisementWhere is auditory-verbal therapy conducted?Auditory-verbal therapy often takes place at the therapist\u2019s office but, more importantly, it also happens in your own home where you\u2019re your child\u2019s first and most important teacher. Keep the following tips in mind when \u201ccoaching\u201d your child:Speak near your child\u2019s hearing aid or the microphone of their cochlear implant.Speak slowly, but as naturally as possible.Don\u2019t speak loudly \u2014 use your regular volume.Get rid of all background noise. This includes fans and air conditioners, as well as background music or other stimuli.Repeat what you say, as needed.Speak expressively and with a melodic rhythm. This can help \u201ccapture\u201d your child auditorily.What kind of healthcare provider provides the therapy?Audiologists and speech-language pathologists work with children who are deaf and hard of hearing. They may also train to become a listening and spoken language specialist (LSLS) who can conduct auditory-verbal therapy with expertise.What\u2019s the difference between auditory-verbal therapy and other types of therapies for the deaf and hard of hearing?Other communication techniques like lip-reading and sign language depend on visual cues. This can leave the auditory cortex of your child\u2019s brain unstimulated. AVT helps your child develop their \u201cauditory brain\u201d \u2014 their ability to listen and talk.Auditory-verbal therapy also involves a child\u2019s caregivers. Caregivers are coached on different techniques and strategies so they can teach their child at home during play and other activities throughout the day.How does auditory-verbal therapy work?An auditory-verbal therapy session includes your child, your child\u2019s caregivers (this can include parents, siblings, grandparents, etc.) and their clinician. Your child will be taught how to listen and speak through natural interactions like:Playing.Talking.Singing.Playing games.There are 10 principles that auditory-verbal therapists go by:Promote early diagnosis of hearing loss in newborns, infants, toddlers and young children, followed by immediate audiologic management and auditory-verbal therapy.Recommend immediate assessment and use of appropriate state-of-the-art hearing technology to obtain maximum benefits of auditory stimulation.Guide and coach parents to help their child use hearing as the primary sensory modality in developing listening and spoken language.Guide and coach parents to become the primary facilitators of their child\u2019s listening and spoken language development through active consistent participation in individualized auditory-verbal therapy.Guide and coach parents to create environments that support listening for the acquisition of spoken language throughout the child\u2019s daily activities.Guide and coach parents to help their child integrate listening and spoken language into all aspects of the child\u2019s life.Guide and coach parents to use natural developmental patterns of audition, speech, language, cognition and communication.Guide and coach parents to help their child self-monitor spoken language through listening.Administer ongoing formal and informal diagnostic assessments to develop individualized auditory-verbal treatment plans to monitor progress and to evaluate the effectiveness of the plans for the child and family.Promote education in mainstream schools with peers who have typical hearing and with appropriate services from early childhood onwards.With the application of the above-listed principles, parents can become the most important \u201cchange agent\u201d for their children, and in conjunction with today\u2019s incredible \u201chearing sensory technology,\u201d even children with severe and profound hearing loss can make use of auditory information to develop spoken language \u2014 through listening!Why does audio-verbal therapy work?Your child\u2019s brain has optimal neural plasticity in their first three and a half years. \u201cOptimal neural plasticity\u201d means that it\u2019s easier for their brain to adapt and change through learning and early stimulation. You\u2019ll need to take advantage of this narrow window to help your child\u2019s future.The brain of an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing can become a \u201cvisual\u201d brain instead of a \u201cvisual and auditory\u201d brain. Ideally, you\u2019ll want your child to be able to see visual cues after establishing an ability to listen, instead of just one or the other.Procedure DetailsHow do I prepare for auditory-verbal therapy?Be sure that your child\u2019s hearing aids or cochlear implants are working before you go to a lesson.
