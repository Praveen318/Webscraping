Recovery usually takes four to six weeks. Making lifestyle changes after surgery can help you live a long, healthy life.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewHow is an ascending aortic aneurysm repaired?An ascending aortic aneurysm is repaired through traditional open surgery. Your surgeon removes the weakened part of your ascending aorta and replaces it with a graft (synthetic fabric tube). This graft functions as a new lining for your artery so blood can pass through.A cardiac surgeon performs this procedure in a hospital surgical suite.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs ascending aortic aneurysm repair?If you have a ruptured or dissected aneurysm in your ascending aorta, you have what\u2019s called Type A dissection, and you need surgery. It\u2019s an emergency surgery that can save your life.You might also need surgery if you have an aneurysm that\u2019s at risk of rupture or dissection. Your provider will check your aneurysm once or twice a year using imaging tests. Sometimes an aneurysm that\u2019s very small or stable in size doesn\u2019t need treatment for a while. But if the aneurysm is large or shows signs of rapid growth, you\u2019ll need surgery to prevent rupture or dissection.Your provider will recommend surgery if the risks of delaying treatment outweigh the risks of surgery.Most thoracic aortic aneurysms (six out of 10) occur in the ascending aorta. Less often, they occur in the descending aorta or aortic arch.When should an ascending aortic aneurysm be repaired?The best timing for ascending aortic aneurysm repair depends on many factors. The most important is whether you have symptoms. Others include the aneurysm\u2019s size and how fast it\u2019s growing. Your body size and your particular medical conditions also play a role.Symptoms of rupture or dissectionIf you have chest pain, you might need emergency surgery. This could signal the aneurysm is about to rupture.Call 911 if you have the following symptoms:Sudden, severe pain in your chest or upper back. It may feel like something is tearing or ripping inside you.Chest pain of any kind.Clammy, sweaty skin.Coughing, feeling hoarse or having trouble breathing.Dizziness.Fainting.Fast heartbeat.Nausea and vomiting.Shortness of breath.Aneurysm sizeAneurysm size is one of the key factors that determine when you need elective (planned) surgery. You may need surgery when the aneurysm diameter reaches:In general, 5.5 centimeters.For people with Marfan syndrome, 4.5 centimeters.For people with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, 4.0 centimeters.Aneurysm growth rateYou\u2019ll need surgery soon if your aneurysm is growing quickly. That\u2019s true even if the aneurysm is considered smaller (below 5.5 centimeters). You need surgery if:The aneurysm is growing 1 centimeter per year or 0.5 centimeters per six months (in general).The aneurysm is growing 0.5 centimeters per year for people with certain conditions. These include some connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve or chronic dissection.Individual factorsYour provider will also take into account individual factors like your body size and medical conditions. For example, someone with a smaller body size may need surgery sooner. Your provider will use a formula to calculate the risk of rupture based on your body size and aneurysm size. This can lead to surgeries for aneurysms below 5 centimeters in diameter.If you need another type of heart surgery, your provider may advise aneurysm repair at the same time. In that case, the aneurysm diameter could be as small as 4 centimeters. It\u2019s wise to fix it sooner to prevent future problems and avoid multiple surgeries.Your provider will talk with you about your unique needs. Your age, family history and underlying medical conditions can impact how you respond to the surgery. So, your provider will weigh the risks and benefits of having surgery sooner rather than later. Ask your provider if you have questions or concerns at any point.AdvertisementCan endovascular methods be used to repair an ascending aortic aneurysm?Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) repairs aneurysms in your descending thoracic aorta. That\u2019s the part of your aorta that extends from the aortic arch down to the diaphragm. But TEVAR is rarely used for your ascending aorta (the first part that comes out of your heart). These two parts of your aorta (ascending and descending) have differences in anatomy and blood pressure. TEVAR was designed for the descending aorta.However, in rare emergency situations, TEVAR has been used for the ascending aorta. It can save people who had a dissection but are too medically fragile to survive traditional surgery.Researchers are developing new devices specifically for the ascending aorta. This exciting research shows much promise. In the future, endovascular methods could repair ascending aortic aneurysms. For now, though, traditional open surgery remains the preferred method.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before ascending aortic aneurysm repair?You\u2019ll have a physical exam several weeks before your surgery. Your provider will run tests and also talk with you about your health. Preoperative tests may include:Blood work to check your kidney function.CT orHeart MRI to check all parts of your aorta. Sometimes other problems with your aorta, like aortic valve disease, can be treated during the same surgery. Your provider will discuss this option with you.Coronary angiography to check for atherosclerosis.Duplex ultrasound to check the health of your carotid arteries. Untreated problems with your carotid arteries can raise your risk of a stroke during surgery. People over age 65 and people with peripheral artery disease or other risk factors need this test.You\u2019ll talk with your provider about:Medicines you\u2019re taking. Your provider needs to know what drugs, supplements and herbs you\u2019re using. These include prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Your provider may ask you to stop taking some medicines as you prepare for surgery.Medical conditions. You\u2019ll need to manage conditions like high blood pressure before your surgery. You may need to take antibiotics if you have chronic bronchitis.How you\u2019re feeling. If you have a cold, flu, herpes breakout or any other illness, tell your provider. Being sick could impact how you respond to surgery.Smoking or using tobacco products. You should not smoke for at least one month leading up to your surgery. Your provider can share resources to help you quit.Your provider will give you detailed instructions for the day of your surgery. These may include:Not drinking anything after midnight the night before your surgery. That includes water.Taking certain drugs the morning of your surgery.Planning for someone to drive you to the hospital and pick you up after recovery.Be sure to ask your provider if you have any questions or if anything is unclear. Good preparation is essential for a successful surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens during ascending aortic aneurysm repair?Your surgeon will replace the weakened part of your aorta with a graft (synthetic fabric tube). If other parts of your aorta are damaged, like the aortic root or aortic arch, your surgeon can fix those parts at the same time. Your surgeon may also replace your aortic valve if needed. The extent of surgery depends on your aorta\u2019s condition as well as your medical history and family history.Once you\u2019re moved to the operating room, your care team will help you feel comfortable and relaxed. You\u2019ll be given general anesthesia that puts you to sleep during the surgery. During parts of your surgery, you\u2019ll be on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass). Your care team may also use deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) to stop your blood circulation.Your surgery will include the following steps:Incision. Your surgeon will make an incision in the front of your chest (median sternotomy).Clamping. Your surgeon will use a tool called an aortic cross-clamp to pause blood flow through your ascending aorta.Graft insertion. Your surgeon will replace the bulging section of your ascending aorta with a tube called a graft. This graft functions as a new lining for your artery. Your surgeon will sew the graft in place with stitches.Closure. Your surgeon will close the incision in your chest with stitches or staples.This surgery usually takes three to four hours. The time can vary based on how many issues need to be fixed.What happens after ascending aortic aneurysm repair?You\u2019ll be moved to the intensive care unit (ICU). You\u2019ll be closely watched for a few days before moving to a regular hospital room. Your total hospital stay will likely be four to 10 days.While you\u2019re in the hospital, you\u2019ll receive:A urinary catheter to help you pee.A tube through your nose and stomach that drains fluids.Blood-thinning medication (anticoagulants).Compression socks that help prevent blood clots in your legs.A breathing machine to help support your lungs.Pain medication to ease your recovery.You\u2019ll slowly move around more to regain your strength. But it\u2019s important to follow your provider\u2019s guidance and take things slowly.Make sure to find someone to drive you home from the hospital. You won\u2019t be able to drive until your provider says it\u2019s OK.Care at Cleveland ClinicAortic Disease TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of ascending aortic aneurysm repair?As an elective surgery, ascending aortic aneurysm repair prevents a rupture or dissection.

About 95% to 98% of people survive elective surgery. But thoracic aortic aneurysm ruptures and dissections are often fatal. About 1 in 5 people who have a rupture or dissection don\u2019t live long enough to have surgery. Those who have emergency surgery are less likely to survive than those undergoing elective surgery.About 85% of people who have elective thoracic aortic aneurysm repair survive for at least five years. That number drops to 37% for people who have emergency surgery after a rupture or dissection.What is the life expectancy for people who have ascending aortic aneurysm repair?The life expectancy is normal for those who have elective surgery (before a rupture or dissection).
