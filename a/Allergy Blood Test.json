Antibodies are proteins your immune system produced in response to harmful substances such as viruses or bacteria. If you have an allergy, your body produces IgE in response to the allergen even if it\u2019s harmless.Common allergens include:Certain foods or ingredients.Dust.Latex.Insect bites and stings.Mold.Pet dander.Pollen.Some medications.They used to call this type of allergy test a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) because it used radioactivity, but now it no longer uses radioactivity.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyAre there different types of allergy blood tests?There are two types of allergy blood tests:Total IgE test: Measures the total amount of IgE in your blood.Specific IgE test: Measures the IgE in your blood in response to specific allergens.Allergy blood test vs. allergy skin test: What\u2019s the difference?Allergy blood tests and allergy skin tests are two of the most common forms of allergy testing. During an allergy skin test, your healthcare provider creates tiny pinpricks in your skin and then applies an allergen to check for a reaction.Skin tests deliver immediate results, but blood tests take a few days. Skin tests tend to be more accurate, but some people can\u2019t have allergy skin tests. If you have a skin condition such as hives or a rash, or you\u2019re taking antihistamines, allergy skin tests won\u2019t deliver reliable results. In these cases, you may need an allergy blood test.AdvertisementWhen is an allergy blood test needed?You may need an allergy blood test if you have:Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), usually the result of pollen, pet allergies or mold (aspergillosis).Anaphylaxis, which is a severe and sometimes life-threatening allergic reaction to certain foods, insect stings or other allergens.Contact dermatitis, caused by contact with irritants such as chemicals, detergents, poisonous plants or certain metals (such as a nickel allergy).Allergy symptoms may include:Abdominal pain.Cough.Diarrhea.Dry skin.Eczema.Headache.Hives (urticaria) and swelling (angioedema).Itchy, red or watery eyes.Nausea and vomiting.Shortness of breath (dyspnea).Skin rash.Sneezing.Sore throat (pharyngitis).Stuffy, itchy or runny nose.Swollen lips, tongue, eyes or face.Wheezing, tightness in your chest or allergic asthma.Procedure DetailsHow do I prepare for an allergy blood test?You don\u2019t need to do anything special to prepare for an allergy blood test. In some cases, your healthcare provider may want you to fast (not eat or drink) before the test. It's important to let your provider know if you take antihistamines. They might ask you to stop taking this medication before your test.AdvertisementWhat happens during an allergy blood test?An allergy blood test only takes a few minutes. A healthcare provider called a lab technician usually takes blood samples in your doctor\u2019s office or a lab.Here\u2019s what you can expect:The phlebotomist (a healthcare provider who draws blood) takes blood from a vein in your arm using a thin needle.The needle might cause a mild pinch and some discomfort.The phlebotomist fills a collection tube with blood and then removes the needle.They place a small bandage on your arm.Are there any risks with an allergy blood test?An allergy blood test doesn\u2019t carry serious risks. Some people have bruising, light bleeding or soreness on the inside of their arm. These symptoms usually go away within a day or two.Care at Cleveland ClinicAllergy TestingFind A Doctor and SpecialistsMake An AppointmentAdditional Common QuestionsWhen will I know the results of my allergy blood test?You may need to wait several days for the results of your allergy blood test, though it could take more or less time. Ask your healthcare provider when you can expect your results.What do allergy blood test results mean?Everyone has some IgE in their blood, but elevated levels may indicate an allergy. Different labs use different brands of allergy blood tests, so the \u201cscoring\u201d system for results can vary from brand to brand. Allergy blood tests don\u2019t indicate the severity of an allergy. So if you do have an allergy, talk to your doctor about the risk of anaphylaxis. You may need to carry an emergency epinephrine injection with you at all times.Do allergy blood tests ever deliver false-positive results?About 50% to 60% of all allergy blood tests give false-positive results. False-positive results show you have an allergy even when you don\u2019t. Sometimes false positives happen if your body is reacting slightly to substances in certain foods you\u2019ve eaten recently.A note from Cleveland ClinicAn allergy blood test checks your blood for certain antibodies that increase if you have an allergy. Your healthcare provider might order one if you have a skin condition, take antihistamines or can\u2019t have a skin allergy test for any reason. It\u2019s important to remember that allergy blood tests often deliver false-positive results and they can\u2019t determine the severity of an allergy. If you have an allergy, talk to your provider about ways to reduce your risk of an allergic reaction.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 02/07/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
