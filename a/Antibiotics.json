But they\u2019re not for every sickness, and they can cause side effects like diarrhea. Learning when you need antibiotics and how to take them properly can help you benefit from these medications with the least risk.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat are antibiotics?Antibiotics are medications that fight bacterial infections. They don\u2019t work against viral infections like cold or flu.Bacteria are microscopic germs that live inside your body, on your skin and all around you. Most types of bacteria won\u2019t hurt you. Some types (like some in your gut or on your skin) help keep you healthy. But certain bacteria can make you sick, with the effects ranging from a mild infection to a severe one that lands you in the hospital.That\u2019s why antibiotics are so important. They can help you feel better and are often lifesaving. But when it comes to antibiotics, it\u2019s possible to have too much of a good thing. Using antibiotics when they\u2019re not needed \u2014 like for viral infections or mild bacterial infections that would go away on their own \u2014 can lead to unnecessary side effects and contribute to the global problem of antibiotic resistance.Most people need antibiotics at some point during their lives, and probably many times. You can reap the benefits of antibiotics by following your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions on when you need them and how to use them. You can also learn how these medications work and what they treat. This knowledge can empower you to understand what\u2019s going on inside your body and how to play an active role in your treatment.How do antibiotics work?Antibiotics work by killing bacteria or stopping them from multiplying. For example, antibiotics can kill bacteria by destroying crucial parts they need to survive, like their cell walls or DNA. Antibiotics can stop the growth of bacteria by preventing them from making certain proteins they need to multiply.What does \u201cantibiotic\u201d mean?An antibiotic refers to any substance that stops bacteria from growing. The antibiotics you take may be entirely made from natural products. Or, they may include synthetic (made in a lab) substances. Scientists are constantly researching and developing new antibiotics to fight infections.Proper antibiotic useFor antibiotics to work as they should (and help you feel better), you need to use them properly. Here are some tips:Take your antibiotics exactly as your provider instructs. They\u2019ll tell you the total course of your treatment (how many days you need to take the antibiotics). They\u2019ll also tell you how many times per day you need to take them, and whether or not you should take them with food. Ask if anything is unclear.Don\u2019t save any of your antibiotics for a later time. This isn\u2019t safe and won\u2019t help you in the future. You should only use antibiotics to treat the specific infection you received them for.Don\u2019t take medicine a provider prescribed for someone else. Prescriptions are like custom-made outfits. They\u2019re tailored to you and your needs, including the type of infection you have and other factors like your health history and allergies.Safely throw away unused medicine. Usually, you\u2019ll receive the exact amount of medicine you need. But if you have any medicine left over, ask a pharmacist what to do with it.What conditions do antibiotics treat?Antibiotics treat a wide range of conditions that affect many different parts of your body, from your innermost organs to the outer surface of your skin. Below are some examples.Skin and soft tissue infectionsCellulitis.Gas gangrene.Impetigo.Infections from animal or human bites.Necrotizing fasciitis.Staph infection.Infections in your throat and respiratory systemBacterial pneumonia.Strep throat.Whooping cough.Infections in your urinary system and reproductive systemBacterial vaginosis (BV).Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Urinary tract infection (UTI).Eye infectionsPink eye.Orbital cellulitis.Other conditionsAnthrax.Endocarditis.Lyme disease.Sepsis due to a bacterial infection.When should you not use antibiotics?You shouldn\u2019t take antibiotics for viral infections. Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses. So, they won\u2019t work against conditions like:The flu.A common cold or runny nose.Most instances of bronchitis.A sore throat (unless it\u2019s strep throat).A sinus infection caused by a virus.You likely don\u2019t need antibiotics for some bacterial infections that typically go away on their own. These include:Some sinus infections caused by bacteria.Some ear infections.Your healthcare provider will tell you if you need antibiotics for these common infections.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat forms do antibiotics come in?Antibiotics come in several different forms, including:Oral antibiotics. These are medicines you take by mouth. They may be tablets or capsules that you swallow, or liquids that you drink.Topical antibiotics. These are medicines you apply on the outside of your body. For example, you may rub a cream or antibiotic ointment onto your skin. Or, you may put antibiotic drops into your eyes or ears to treat certain infections.Injections and intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A healthcare provider gives you these medicines through an injection into your muscle or an IV in your vein. Providers typically use these forms for more serious infections.What are the different types of antibiotics?Antibiotics are powerful because they aren\u2019t just a single type of medicine. Antibiotics are a large collection of medicines, and no two are exactly alike.Imagine a walk-in closet that has hundreds of outfits in all different styles. One day you need a suit because you\u2019re giving a presentation. The next day you must spend eight hours doing yard work. So, you choose a long-sleeved shirt to protect your arms from thorns and sunlight and some old, soft jeans you can kneel down in. But you\u2019d never dream of wearing your suit to dig up weeds.It\u2019s similar with antibiotics. Your provider chooses what you need in each specific situation. A medicine that worked for one infection might not be appropriate for another one down the road. Your provider knows the chemical structure of each medicine and how it\u2019ll work in your body, just as you know your wardrobe and which pieces meet a given day\u2019s demands.Just like you think of your clothes in terms of groups (like formal wear and casual wear), healthcare providers classify antibiotics into groups, or classes. Within each class, there are specific medicines, and those are the names you see on your prescription label.The chart below lists some of the antibiotic classes used in the U.S. along with examples of the individual medicines your provider might prescribe. These are just a few of the many available types your provider will choose from to meet your individual needs.List of antibioticsAntibiotic classMedicines your provider may prescribePenicillinsPenicillin; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin.CephalosporinsCephalexin; Cefazolin; Cefdinir; Cefaclor; Cefepime; Ceftaroline.MacrolidesAzithromycin; Erythromycin; Clarithromycin.TetracyclinesTetracycline; Doxycycline; Minocycline.Beta-lactams with increased activityAmoxicillin/clavulanate; Ceftazidime/avibactam.QuinolonesCiprofloxacin; Levofloxacin.AminoglycosidesStreptomycin; Gentamicin; Tobramycin.LincosamidesClindamycin.NitroimidazolesMetronidazole; Tinidazole.Antibiotic classAntibiotic classPenicillinsMedicines your provider may prescribePenicillin; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin.CephalosporinsMedicines your provider may prescribeCephalexin; Cefazolin; Cefdinir; Cefaclor; Cefepime; Ceftaroline.MacrolidesMedicines your provider may prescribeAzithromycin; Erythromycin; Clarithromycin.TetracyclinesMedicines your provider may prescribeTetracycline; Doxycycline; Minocycline.Beta-lactams with increased activityMedicines your provider may prescribeAmoxicillin/clavulanate; Ceftazidime/avibactam.QuinolonesMedicines your provider may prescribeCiprofloxacin; Levofloxacin.AminoglycosidesMedicines your provider may prescribeStreptomycin; Gentamicin; Tobramycin.LincosamidesMedicines your provider may prescribeClindamycin.NitroimidazolesMedicines your provider may prescribeMetronidazole; Tinidazole.What are prophylactic antibiotics?Prophylactic antibiotics are medications your provider gives you to prevent bacterial infection. Your provider may decide you need prophylactic antibiotics (also called antibiotic prophylaxis) if you:Are having certain surgeries or procedures, including some dental procedures.Have a health condition that raises your risk of infection.Have a wound or bite that could become infected.What are broad-spectrum antibiotics?Broad-spectrum antibiotics are medicines that can target lots of different types of bacteria. Examples include quinolones and tetracyclines. These medicines can be useful in certain situations, like when it\u2019s not clear which type of bacteria is making you sick.But using them when they\u2019re not needed can fuel the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Such bacteria don\u2019t respond as expected to antibiotics and are much harder to treat. They\u2019re like a stubborn stain in your carpet that won\u2019t go away no matter how many different stain removers you use on it.So, experts advise using broad-spectrum antibiotics only when necessary. If you need one, your provider will tell you why you need it and how it\u2019ll help you.How long does it take for antibiotics to work?It depends on the type of antibiotic you\u2019re using and what it\u2019s treating. No matter the situation, you need to take a full course of antibiotics exactly as your provider prescribes it. You may start to feel better in just a few days, but you should still take the rest of the medicine. It\u2019s common for your symptoms to ease up before the infection is totally gone from your body.How long do antibiotics stay in your system?Antibiotics typically stay in your system anywhere from a few hours to several days after you stop taking them. Many factors (including the type of antibiotic you\u2019re taking, its dosage and your age) can affect the amount of time the drug stays in your system. Talk to your provider to learn more about the specific medication you\u2019re taking and how long it\u2019ll stay in your body.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of antibiotics?Antibiotics have many benefits.

You should also tell them about any herbal or vitamin supplements you\u2019re using. Your provider needs this information to prescribe an antibiotic that\u2019s safe for you.Antibiotic resistanceAntibiotic resistance is a global public health problem. It happens when bacteria adapt so that they no longer respond to antibiotics that could previously get rid of them.AdvertisementRecovery and OutlookHow long will it take for me to feel better?It depends on the type of infection you have and your treatment plan.

You may remember taking them a few years back for strep throat and feeling like a new person after just a couple of days.

It won\u2019t help, and it might even make things worse.Talk to your healthcare provider any time you have questions or concerns about treatments, including antibiotics. They can help explain why you need or don\u2019t need certain medicines and how best to care for yourself at home.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 05/24/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
