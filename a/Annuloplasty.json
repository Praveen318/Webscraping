Often, providers use a minimally invasive approach to perform an annuloplasty.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is an annuloplasty?An annuloplasty is a procedure to repair or reinforce a heart valve. With annuloplasty, a surgeon places a band around the ring that surrounds your heart valve (annulus). This band reinforces the ring to help your heart valve close as tightly as it should.Your heart valves open and close to send blood through your heart. If a valve doesn\u2019t close correctly, blood may leak backward and your heart may not pump blood as efficiently through your body.Sometimes, leaky heart valves cause mild symptoms. But they can also lead to complications such as heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest. If your healthcare provider diagnoses a leaky heart valve, it\u2019s important to get treatment.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is an annuloplasty ring?During annuloplasty, surgeons place a ring-like device around your heart valve. The ring may be mesh, metal or plastic. The ring mimics your heart valve\u2019s natural movement and flexibility. It stays in place permanently and helps the valve open and close properly.Who needs to have an annuloplasty?You may need an annuloplasty if you have a leaky heart valve (valve regurgitation). Healthcare providers can perform an annuloplasty on any heart valve. You may need one of several types of annuloplasty to treat valve regurgitation:Mitral valve annuloplasty is a type of mitral valve repair.Aortic valve annuloplasty is a type of aortic valve repair.Pulmonary valve annuloplasty is a type of pulmonary valve repair.Tricuspid valve annuloplasty is a type of tricuspid valve repair.AdvertisementIs annuloplasty the only treatment for valve regurgitation?No. Your provider may use other treatments for valve regurgitation. For example, a common minimally invasive treatment for mitral valve disease is surgery to place a MitraClip\u00ae.The MitraClip is a small clip that helps the mitral valve close tightly. Providers place the MitraClip using small incisions and a small, hollow tube (catheter) through your groin.What is the difference between annuloplasty and valvuloplasty?Annuloplasty is a procedure to tighten a leaky heart valve. Valvuloplasty is a procedure to open a narrowed heart valve (stenosis).Healthcare providers can perform both procedures using minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive treatments use tiny incisions, tools and cameras. Compared to open surgery, they often lead to quicker recovery and a lower risk of complications.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsDuring annuloplasty, surgeons place a ring-like device around your heart valve.What happens before an annuloplasty?Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions to prepare for an annuloplasty. You will likely have to fast (not drink or eat) before the procedure, usually starting the night before.If you have bleeding risks, let your provider know. If you take blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants) you may have to stop taking them temporarily before the procedure.What happens during an annuloplasty?Cardiac surgeons (surgeons specializing in the heart) perform annuloplasties. They can use either open-heart surgery or minimally invasive techniques. Both procedures use general anesthesia so you stay asleep during treatment.In open-heart annuloplasty, your surgeon will:Make one large incision in your chest.Place a ring of plastic, metal or surgical mesh around your heart valve.Close the incision with stitches or surgical glue.In minimally invasive annuloplasty, your surgeon will:Make a few small incisions in your chest.Place a small, flexible tube with a camera (endoscope) through the incisions.Use the camera view and tiny surgical tools to place the annuloplasty ring.Close the incision with surgical glue or incisions.What happens after an annuloplasty?After the procedure, you spend a few hours in a recovery area. If you had minimally invasive annuloplasty, you can usually return home in one to two days. After open heart annuloplasty, you may need to stay in the hospital for up to seven days.Care at Cleveland ClinicHeart Valve CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of an annuloplasty?An annuloplasty reinforces a leaky heart valve.
