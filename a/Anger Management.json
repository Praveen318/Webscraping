It\u2019s that feeling that leads you to shake your fist into your rearview mirror or mutter something under your breath when someone cuts you off in traffic. Or holler at a losing sports team. It can make a toddler bite \u2014 or a teen stomp to their room and slam their door \u2014 when they don\u2019t get their own way.So, what\u2019s behind all this? Anger is an emotional reaction to a situation that motivates you to make changes. It stimulates your sympathetic nervous system to trigger a fight-or-flight response, which starts a number of physical changes. Your heart rate and breathing speed up. Your body floods with stress hormones and more blood goes to your muscles. Your focus increases. All this means you have more resources to move away from danger.
