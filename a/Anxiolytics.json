Because so many medications have this effect, this includes many different medications across several types. They\u2019re among the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide.ContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat are anxiolytics?Anxiolytics are medications that can treat anxiety symptoms. Medications with this effect span several different drug classes, including medications that mainly treat other conditions.\u201cAnxiolytic\u201d combines two root words from ancient Greek, \u201canxio-\u201d meaning \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201c-lytic,\u201d meaning \u201cto loosen.\u201d These medications \u201cloosen\u201d anxiety\u2019s hold on you. Some experts also refer to them as \u201canti-anxiety\u201d medications.Types of anxiolyticsMany different types of drugs have anxiolytic effects. These include:Antidepressants.Antihistamines.Azapirones.Barbiturates (no longer used for anxiety).Benzodiazepines.Beta-blockers.Nonbenzodiazepines (also known as Z-drugs).Sedative-hypnotics.How do anxiolytics work?Because there are so many different types of anxiolytics, there are also multiple ways that reduce anxiety. These ways break down into a few different categories:Increase cell activity: Some drugs tell certain cells to activate. Benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines and barbiturates are examples of this. They activate a process that makes your body release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter your body uses to reduce nervous system activity, which helps anxiety.Decrease cell activity: Beta-blockers are an example of this, slowing down activity in your sympathetic nervous system (the system that manages your \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response).Slow reabsorption of neurotransmitters: Some drugs keep your body from reabsorbing certain neurotransmitters. That means you have more of those neurotransmitters available. Antidepressants have this effect on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine.Some medications can have multiple effects. The azapirone drug buspirone and the antihistamine drug hydroxyzine are examples of this. They can increase activity in certain cells and decrease it in others.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

They can also treat conditions that have similarities to anxiety disorders. The possible conditions that may involve anxiolytics as treatment include (but aren\u2019t limited to) the following:Generalized anxiety disorder.Panic disorder.Specific phobia.Agoraphobia.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Some drugs with anxiolytic effects mainly treat other conditions but also see \u201coff-label\u201d use for anxiety. Off-label prescribing is a legal practice where healthcare providers prescribe drugs for reasons other than the approved use. This is medically acceptable and justified if the drug has a known helpful effect and a low risk of harmful side effects. Beta-blockers are an example of this. They mainly treat heart and circulatory issues, but providers often prescribe them off-label for certain types of anxiety.Are anxiolytics commonly prescribed?Anxiety is a common condition, meaning, anxiolytic drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. In the United States alone, tens of millions of people have prescriptions to treat anxiety. Additionally, medications with anxiolytic effects are common in treating other conditions.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of anxiolytics?There are many potential advantages and benefits to anxiolytics.Research and study historyAnxiety is a common condition, so anxiolytics have been a part or focus of study and research for decades. That means healthcare providers have a greater understanding of prescribing and using them safely and effectively.Variety of medications and medication typesOne of the biggest advantages of anxiolytic medications is that so many different drugs have this effect. That means if one drug doesn't work, there are other options. It may take some trial and error, but generally, it's possible to find a medication or combination of medications that work for you.Contributions to other treatment approachesAnxiolytics can also make other types of mental health treatments for anxiety more effective. When used together, anxiolytics and mental health therapy (the technical term is \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d) typically have a much higher success rate for managing anxiety and related mental health conditions.Potential to improve quality of life and well-beingIt\u2019s also beneficial to treat anxiety in general. Anxiety is a condition that can greatly disrupt your life and reduce your quality of life. Having anxiety can disrupt your ability to work, have relationships, or just get a good night\u2019s sleep. Anxiety can also be a factor that contributes to several other chronic conditions, including (but not limited to) the following:Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Cognitive impairment and dementia.Depression.Diabetes.Heart attack and heart disease.Hyperthyroidism.Parkinson\u2019s disease.Stroke.Because of this, treating anxiety is a very important part of restoring and maintaining your overall physical and mental health and well-being.What are the possible disadvantages, side effects and complications of anxiolytics?Depending on the medication(s) you take, anxiolytics can have side effects, complications or possible drawbacks. Some of these include:Variable effectiveness: No two people are exactly alike when it comes to how a medication affects them. Some people may get good results from one, and others won\u2019t get any benefit from it. That can sometimes mean it\u2019ll take a little longer to find a drug that helps you.Addiction potential: Some anxiolytics have no prescription restrictions. Others are \u2014 depending on your location \u2014 tightly controlled and regulated. Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, which can be habit-forming, have the potential for misuse and carry a risk of overdose. For those reasons, some anxiolytics are only recommended for short-term use.Interactions: Anxiolytics can affect many body systems, not just your nervous system. The potential for interactions can vary widely depending on the medication(s) you take. Many of these drugs also interact with alcohol, so if you take certain anxiolytics, drinking alcohol is either not recommended, dangerous or both. You should also talk to your healthcare provider about the supplements you take (especially before you start taking them) to be sure they don\u2019t interact with your medications.Side effects: Anxiolytics often make you tired, sleepy or otherwise slow your reaction times. That may mean driving, operating machinery or engaging in other activities while you take them is unsafe. Other anxiolytics, such as beta-blockers, can also affect other organs like your heart. Because of that, your provider may recommend avoiding certain anxiolytic drugs.There are other possible drawbacks to anxiolytics. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the possible concerns you might face. The information they provide will be the most relevant to your situation. They can also tell you what you can do to minimize or avoid possible problems.AdvertisementRecovery and OutlookHow long can I stay on anxiolytics?The length of time you can stay on an anxiolytic depends on many factors.

Others, you can take indefinitely.

Some, such as benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, may make you sleepy. If you take these drugs, you should talk to your provider before you drive or work after taking them. Your provider can help you determine if it\u2019s safe for you to engage in certain activities when these drugs are active. They can also help you find a schedule and dosage that causes minimal or no disruptions in your daily life, routine and activities.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Anxiety is a condition that can severely undermine your mental health and well-being.
