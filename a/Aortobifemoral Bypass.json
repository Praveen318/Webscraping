This surgery improves blood flow to your legs.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is aortobifemoral bypass?Aortobifemoral bypass is a form of vascular disease bypass surgery that surgeons perform in your abdomen (belly). It\u2019s an open surgery that creates a new route (bypass) for blood to flow around narrowed or blocked portions of your arteries. This improves blood flow to your legs.A vascular surgeon inserts an artificial blood vessel (graft) into your belly in the area of the diseased arteries. The graft typically consists of polyester. \u201cAortobifemoral\u201d refers to the arteries that connect with the graft:\u201cAorto\u201d refers to your aorta, which is the largest artery in your body. It leaves your heart at your aortic valve and extends down through your chest and belly.\u201cFemoral\u201d refers to your femoral arteries, which begin near your groin and travel down each thigh to the back of your knee.\u201cBi\u201d refers to the fact that the graft connects with both of your femoral arteries (you have one in each leg).The graft has the shape of an upside-down letter \u201cY.\u201d The top of the graft connects with the lower portion of your aorta in your belly. Each stem of the Y connects with each of your femoral arteries.Healthcare providers may recommend this surgery if plaque buildup in major arteries in your belly or pelvis causes severe symptoms or places you at high risk for complications.An aortobifemoral bypass graft reroutes blood flow from your abdominal aorta to your femoral arteries.What does this surgery treat?Aortobifemoral bypass surgery treats severe aortoiliac occlusive disease. With this condition, plaque gradually builds up in major arteries in your belly and pelvis. These are your:Abdominal aorta, or the lower part of your aorta that extends straight down through your belly.Iliac arteries, or the arteries that begin at the base of your abdominal aorta (near your belly button). Your two external iliac arteries (one on each side of your body) travel toward your groin, where they become your femoral arteries.Extensive plaque buildup can narrow or block blood flow in your abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. As a result, your lower body (including your legs, feet and organs in your pelvis) can\u2019t receive enough oxygen-rich blood. Severe narrowing or blockages can lead to complications, including:Pain in your legs when you walk (intermittent claudication).Severe leg pain at rest.Gangrene.Amputation.Although bypass surgery can\u2019t cure aortoiliac occlusive disease, it can ease your symptoms by delivering blood flow to your legs. This will decrease the occurrence of the complications mentioned above.How serious is aortobifemoral bypass?Aortobifemoral bypass is an open surgery that requires a large incision in your belly. Healthcare providers consider this major surgery.A minimally-invasive alternative is aortoiliac stenting with bifurcation reconstruction (AISBR). This is a form of endovascular surgery that places a stent inside your clogged arteries to open them up and improve blood flow. Some research shows that AISBR may have a lower risk of surgical complications and a shorter hospital stay than open surgery.Your healthcare provider will determine whether open surgery or endovascular surgery is right for you. Traditionally, surgeons would use AISBR for people with a higher surgical risk. But thanks to advances in technology, surgeons today are using AISBR much more often instead of open surgery.You may need open surgery if you\u2019re not a candidate for endovascular surgery, or if you\u2019ve had endovascular surgery in the past and it wasn\u2019t successful for you.
