During the procedure, your healthcare provider removes a damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial joint. The artificial joint (prosthesis) can be metal, ceramic or heavy-duty plastic. The new joint looks like the natural joint and moves in a similar way.Surgeons can replace joints in any part of your body, but the most common types of arthroplasty are hip replacement and knee replacement.Most people who get this procedure need a total joint replacement. A small number of people are good candidates for a partial joint replacement. This procedure only replaces the part of the joint that\u2019s damaged. Recovery time for arthroplasty varies.
