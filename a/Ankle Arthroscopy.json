Your surgeon will insert a special tool called an arthroscope into your ankle to identify and repair damage. The arthroscope includes a camera and a light that lets your surgeon see what\u2019s going on inside of your ankle while only making a few small incisions (cuts) in your skin. Your surgeon will also insert any other tools they need during the surgery through additional tiny cuts.Because the incisions required to perform an ankle arthroscopy are much smaller than other forms of surgery \u2014 less than half an inch across in most cases \u2014 it\u2019s less stressful on your body than other procedures.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs ankle arthroscopy?Anyone with ankle pain or other issues in their ankle joint that hasn\u2019t responded to other treatments is a good candidate for ankle arthroscopy. It can also help people who are having trouble moving properly because of an issue inside of their ankle joint. Typically, your healthcare provider will recommend arthroscopy after other nonsurgical treatments, like steroid injections or physical therapy, haven\u2019t completely solved your issues.What does ankle arthroscopy treat?Ankle arthroscopy is an effective, minimally invasive surgery that can treat a wide range of conditions, including:Instability: Something inside of your ankle joint, like a bone deformity, might make it hard to securely stand or move. Your surgeon can diagnose and repair what\u2019s making you unsteady during arthroscopy.Impingement: If tissues in or surrounding your ankle are overused, they can become swollen and sore. Eventually, this swelling causes stiffness that makes it hard to move your ankle.Removing pieces of bone, cartilage or scar tissue: After an injury, your bones or cartilage might be damaged, or loose pieces inside of your joint might cause pain. Your body may have formed scar tissue inside of your joint while the injury healed.Torn ligaments: Ligaments are like rubber bands that hold your bones together. If you tear or damage a ligament in an accident, fall or other trauma, your ankle won\u2019t function properly.AdvertisementHow common is ankle arthroscopy?Ankle arthroscopy is very common, and surgeons are able to treat more conditions than ever before thanks to recent technological advances.Arthroscopy is becoming a standard procedure as surgeons are able to perform increasingly complex operations with less invasive methods and lower risks.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before ankle arthroscopy?Before your ankle arthroscopy, you might need to reduce how often you:Take blood thinners: Tell your surgeon all the medicines you\u2019re taking \u2014 including over-the-counter drugs or supplements. Medicines that thin your blood \u2014 including those prescribed to prevent blood clots \u2014 can be dangerous during and after surgery. Your surgeon will tell you which medications to stop or how to alter your daily routine.Smoke: If you smoke or use other kinds of tobacco products, you should quit at least four weeks before your surgery. In addition to the everyday health risks, smoking makes it harder for your body to heal after a surgery.Drink alcohol: Alcohol thins your blood, which can make it dangerous to have in your system before and after surgery.Eat or drink: Your surgeon will tell you if you need to avoid eating and drinking anything before your ankle arthroscopy. You might need to plan ahead and not eat or drink anything other than water up to 12 hours before surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens during ankle arthroscopy?During an ankle arthroscopy, your surgeon will make a few small cuts (usually less than half an inch across) in the skin around your ankle and insert the arthroscope into your joint. They\u2019ll make additional tiny incisions to insert other tools they need to repair any damage to your bones or connective tissues. Once they\u2019re able to see inside of your ankle with the arthroscope, your surgeon can repair your joint.You\u2019ll receive either regional anesthesia near your ankle to make sure you don\u2019t feel pain during the surgery or general anesthesia to put you to sleep during the operation.Most arthroscopies take around an hour, but the length of your surgery will depend on your unique needs.What is debridement?There are a few techniques your surgeon can use to complete your arthroscopy, depending on what needs fixed. Debridement is one of the most common. Debridement is how surgeons refer to cleaning up something in your body. In the case of ankle arthroscopy, this means removing damaged tissue, or reshaping your bones to fix impingement or arthritis.Think about it this way: It doesn\u2019t matter if your kitchen needs a top-to-bottom scrub or just a little tidying. Either way, it still needs cleaned. Whether it takes all afternoon or just a few minutes, the end result is the same: A kitchen that\u2019s spic and span. It\u2019s the same during your arthroscopy. Even if you need more extensive debridement, your surgeon will be able to clean up your joint to fix what\u2019s causing you pain or discomfort.The more significant your symptoms, the more debridement you\u2019ll likely need. In most cases, it shouldn\u2019t impact your recovery time too much.What happens after ankle arthroscopy?Ankle arthroscopy is almost always an outpatient surgery, and you should be able to go home the same day as your procedure.Your provider or surgeon will go over the results of your surgery and tell you what you need to do to heal and recover.You may need to:Avoid putting weight or pressure on your ankle or foot.Ice and elevate your ankle.Keep the incision clean and covered.Take NSAIDs for pain.Take showers, not baths, until the incision heals. You might also need to keep your incision covered and to prevent it from getting wet.You\u2019ll probably have to wear a splint on your ankle for a few weeks after your surgery. Your surgeon will tell you when you can start moving your ankle and when you\u2019ll start physical therapy.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule Ankle SurgeryFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of ankle arthroscopy?Ankle arthroscopy is one of the least invasive surgeries you can have.
