It stimulates the development of male characteristics. Levels of testosterone are naturally much higher in men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) than in women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB).Healthcare providers mainly prescribe anabolic steroids to treat low testosterone (male hypogonadism). But they use it for other conditions as well, such as to stimulate muscle growth for people with certain cancers or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).Some athletes, bodybuilders and others misuse these drugs in an attempt to enhance performance and/or improve their physical appearance. Anabolic steroids are the most common appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs (APEDs). Anabolic steroid misuse is common.

The cells of this type of breast cancer have receptors that allow them to use estrogen to grow. Anabolic steroids can block the growth of cancer cells by lowering estrogen levels.For people who have muscle atrophy due to cancer or AIDS, anabolic steroids increase the number of androgen receptors in skeletal muscle, which can lead to increased muscle size and strength.Anabolic steroid misuseThe main reason people misuse anabolic steroids is to increase lean muscle mass when using them in conjunction with weight training.Non-athlete weightlifters (bodybuilders) typically misuse them to improve their appearance. Anabolic steroid misuse is often associated with a form of body dysmorphic disorder called muscle dysmorphia.For athletes, increasing muscle mass may also promote strength, which can improve strength-based sports performance.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the side effects of anabolic steroids?Each type of prescription anabolic steroid and each brand has different possible side effects.
