Without them, many of these conditions are so disruptive or severe that they need 24/7 psychiatric care.ContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat are antipsychotics?Antipsychotic medications are drugs that mainly treat psychosis-related conditions and symptoms. But taking an antipsychotic drug doesn\u2019t always mean you have a symptom or condition related to psychosis. That\u2019s because these drugs are very important for treating other conditions, too.What is psychosis?Psychosis isn\u2019t a medical condition. It\u2019s a collection of symptoms that indicate your brain isn\u2019t processing certain kinds of information as it should. The symptoms all involve a disconnection from reality. The main symptoms are hallucinations and delusions. It can also involve disorganized thoughts and actions, or dampen how you show emotions.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Most aren\u2019t commonly used for treating psychosis now.Second-generation antipsychotics. Also known as \u201catypical antipsychotics,\u201d these are now the main drugs for treating psychosis. That\u2019s mostly because they have fewer side effects.First-generation (typical) antipsychoticsChlorpromazine.

Cells throughout your nervous system have receptors, which are like locks, on their surfaces. Neurotransmitters are like keys, and they have very specific shapes.If a neurotransmitter with the right shape attaches to a receptor, it can activate the cell and tell it to do something. Some neurotransmitters have nearly the right shape, but they don\u2019t activate the cell. Instead, they block neurotransmitters that could activate the cell.Antipsychotics rely on the lock-and-key system for neurotransmitters and receptors in different ways:First-generation antipsychotics: These block the way your brain uses several neurotransmitters, especially dopamine. They also block acetylcholine (pronounced \u201cUh-SEE-till-CO-lean\u201d), histamine and norepinephrine from latching onto various receptors.Second-generation antipsychotics: These block certain dopamine and serotonin receptors. But unlike first-generation antipsychotics, these medications don\u2019t just block receptors. They also activate certain other dopamine and serotonin receptors. Blocking some receptors and activating others is why these medications work differently.AdvertisementWhat conditions do antipsychotics treat?Antipsychotics treat conditions that cause or involve psychosis. Those include:Schizophrenia (and its related spectrum of disorders, including schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder).Bipolar disorder.Mania.Major depressive disorder with psychotic features.Delusional disorder.Severe agitation.Borderline personality disorder.Dementia.Delirium.Substance-induced psychotic disorder.Providers may treat other conditions with antipsychotics, but those drugs aren\u2019t their main treatment. These conditions include:Tourette syndrome.Huntington\u2019s disease.Parkinson\u2019s disease.Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.Obsessive-compulsive disorder.Are antipsychotics commonly prescribed?Antipsychotic medications see widespread use. Approximately 4 million adults in the U.S. have a prescription for at least one of these medications.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of antipsychotics?Antipsychotic medications have several benefits, including:Range of conditions they treat. Antipsychotics can treat specific brain-related conditions. They can also treat mental health conditions (many of which happen for brain-related reasons that aren\u2019t fully understood).Type of conditions they treat. Antipsychotics treat conditions that can be very complex, disruptive and severe. Some of these conditions are very difficult (if not impossible) to treat with other kinds of medications. Also, many people with these conditions would need long-term (or even lifelong) care 24/7 without these drugs.History of research and use. First-generation antipsychotics came into use in the early 1950s. The first second-generation antipsychotic came into use in the 1960s. That means these medications have decades of research and study supporting them.Number of drugs available. There are many different types of antipsychotic drugs. That means your healthcare provider can often offer options for you to choose from when recommending a medication.Contributions to other treatment approaches. Antipsychotics can also make other types of mental health treatments more effective. When used together, antipsychotics and mental health therapy (the technical term is \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d) usually have a much better chance of helping a person.What are the possible disadvantages, side effects and complications of antipsychotics?Antipsychotics are useful, but there are possible drawbacks. Antipsychotic medications can have various side effects and complications, including:Drug-induced movement disorders. First-generation and second-generation antipsychotics can cause an inability to hold still (akathisia) or uncontrolled face muscle movements (tardive dyskinesia). Other symptoms include tremors or parkinsonism-like symptoms. They can also cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a possibly deadly complication. Scientists developed second-generation antipsychotics to avoid that side effect.Heart and circulatory problems. Antipsychotic drugs may alter your heart rhythm. They can also cause orthostatic hypotension, which is a blood pressure drop when you stand or sit up quickly that can make you fall or pass out.Interactions. Antipsychotic medications can interact with several other types of medications. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about every medication, supplement, vitamin or herbal remedy you take. That can help them determine if there\u2019s a risk of interactions with an antipsychotic medication they prescribe for you.Metabolism effects. Antipsychotic drugs can cause high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). They can also increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Dizziness and sedation. All antipsychotics can have a sedative effect, meaning they make you tired. They can also cause dizziness, increasing your risk of falls and injuries.High prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia). Antipsychotics can affect your levels of the hormone prolactin. This can affect fertility and cause missed periods (amenorrhea) and leaky discharge from your breasts when you aren\u2019t breastfeeding/chestfeeding (galactorrhea) in women and people assigned female at birth. It can cause infertility and sexual dysfunction in men and people assigned male at birth.Immune disruption. Some antipsychotics can cause agranulocytosis, a dangerous condition that involves a weakening of your immune system.Jaundice. This is when your skin and the whites of your eyes (sclera) turn yellow because of a problem in your liver.Other less serious side effects can include:Weight gain.Dry mouth.Constipation.Urinary retention.Recovery and OutlookHow long can I stay on antipsychotics?Some antipsychotic medications are for short-term use only. Others, you can take for years or even indefinitely. This can vary depending on the medication you take, why you take it, other conditions you have or medications you take, side effects that you experience or want to avoid and much more.

Fortunately, there are many different antipsychotic medications, so your healthcare provider can likely recommend one that has little or no risk of worsening another medical issue you have.If you have any of the following, it\u2019s important to tell your healthcare provider:Liver damage or disease (cirrhosis).Heart disease.A history of stroke or circulatory problems in your brain (cerebrovascular disease).Parkinsonism (including Parkinson\u2019s disease and many conditions that cause similar symptoms).Bone marrow or immune problems.Blood pressure that\u2019s severely high (hypertension) or low (hypotension).Type 2 diabetes.Glaucoma.Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia).Stomach ulcers.Chronic respiratory conditions.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Antipsychotics may cause serious side effects or complications for some people.

That\u2019s because the best or safest antipsychotic drug for you may be different from the best drug for someone else, even someone else with the same condition. The biggest factors that determine what drug is best for you include:The condition you have.The side effects that various drugs might cause.Any conditions that side effects or complications could affect or make worse.Your healthcare provider is the best source of information about which drugs they recommend.
