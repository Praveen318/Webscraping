Healthcare providers prescribe them to treat other conditions as well.Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and a loss of interest in things and activities you once enjoyed. It can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, motivation, eating and sleeping.There are several types of depressive disorders, some of which include:Clinical depression (major depressive disorder).Bipolar depression.Persistent depressive disorder (PDD).Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).Atypical depression.Seasonal depression (seasonal affective disorder).Antidepressants are one type of treatment for depression. While they can treat the symptoms of depression, they don\u2019t always address its causes. This is why healthcare providers often recommend psychotherapy (talk therapy) in addition to depression medication.Antidepressants were invented in the 1950s. Since then, researchers have developed several different types of the medication. Today, antidepressants are one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States.What conditions do antidepressants help treat?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of antidepressants for the following conditions:Clinical depression and other depressive disorders (most common use of antidepressants).Bipolar depression.Bulimia.Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Panic disorder.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Social anxiety disorder (social phobia).Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe antidepressants for other conditions. This is considered an off-label, or non-FDA-approved, use of the medication. For example, providers sometimes prescribe tricyclic antidepressants for chronic pain, insomnia and migraine.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the types of antidepressants?There are several types (classes) of antidepressants, including:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These are the most common type of prescribed antidepressants.Serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs are an older class of antidepressants often reserved for treatment-resistant depression and anxiety due to increased rates of side effects.Atypical antidepressants.Serotonin modulators.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). These are the oldest antidepressants. Though highly effective, they\u2019re often reserved for treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. This is because taking an MAIO requires dietary modifications to avoid hypertensive reactions caused by interactions with the amino acid tyramine, which is present in high levels in some foods.N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists.There are also several kinds of medications (and brands) within each class.How commonly are antidepressants used?Antidepressants are a very commonly used prescription medication. More than 1 in 10 people in the United States take them. The use of antidepressants is increasing across the world.What is the most common type of antidepressant?SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant. Fluoxetine (Prozac\u00ae) is probably the most well-known SSRI.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow do antidepressants work?In general, antidepressants change the way your brain uses certain chemicals (called neurotransmitters) to better regulate your mood and behavior. More specifically, they affect neurotransmission involving serotonin, norepinephrine and, less commonly, dopamine. The different types of antidepressants all work differently to do this.Studies also show that antidepressants induce neuroplasticity, a process by which your brain can alter its structure through strengthening or weakening connections between brain cells called neurons.How do you take antidepressants?Antidepressants typically come in pill (tablet) form. You swallow the pills with a liquid, like water. When you first start taking an antidepressant, your healthcare provider will likely prescribe the lowest possible dose of the medication that they think is necessary to improve your symptoms. Over time, they\u2019ll adjust the dose if necessary.It can take multiple weeks before you start to experience an improvement in your symptoms.Treatment usually lasts at least six months after you start to feel better. If you have recurrent, chronic or severe depression, your provider may recommend taking the antidepressant for the foreseeable future.Care at Cleveland ClinicDepression TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsHow effective are antidepressants?Antidepressants are the most effective medication for treating depression symptoms.
