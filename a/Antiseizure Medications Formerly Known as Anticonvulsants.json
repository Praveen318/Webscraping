They can treat other conditions as well, like anxiety and neuropathic pain. There are several different types of antiseizure medications. You and your healthcare provider will work together to find the best one for you.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat are antiseizure medications (anticonvulsants)?Antiseizure medications (previously known as antiepileptic or anticonvulsant medications) are prescription medications that help treat and prevent seizures. Healthcare providers may prescribe these medications to treat other conditions as well.A seizure happens when you have a temporary, unstoppable surge of electrical activity in your brain. This overloads the affected areas of your brain. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:Abnormal sensations.Loss of awareness.Falling.Uncontrolled muscle movements (convulsions).People most commonly associate epilepsy with seizures, but there are several other causes of seizures (often called symptomatic seizures).Why are these medications no longer called anticonvulsants?Healthcare providers now call these medications antiseizure medications because they help treat and prevent seizures. While people often associate seizures with convulsions, not every seizure involves convulsions (jerking movements). For example, some seizures cause temporary confusion, a staring spell and/or loss of consciousness or awareness.Therefore, \u201cantiseizure medications\u201d is a more accurate term than \u201canticonvulsants\u201d to describe what these medications help treat.List of antiseizure medications (anticonvulsants)Healthcare providers can prescribe several types of antiseizure medications in the United States. They include:Brivaracetam (Briviact\u00ae).Cannabidiol (Epidiolex\u00ae).Carbamazepine (Epitol\u00ae, Tegretol\u00ae).Cenobamate (Xcopri\u00ae).Clobazam (Onfi\u00ae).Clonazepam (Ceberclon\u00ae, Klonopin\u00ae).Eslicarbazepine (Aptiom\u00ae).Ethosuximide (Zarontin\u00ae).Felbamate (Felbatol\u00ae).Fosphenytoin (Cerebyx\u00ae).Gabapentin (Horizant\u00ae, Gralise\u00ae, Neurontin\u00ae).Lacosamide (Vimpat\u00ae).Levetiracetam (Keppra\u00ae, Roweepra\u00ae).Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal\u00ae).Perampanel (Fycompa\u00ae).Phenobarbital (Solfoton\u00ae, Luminal\u00ae).Phenytoin (Dilantin\u00ae, Phenytek\u00ae).Pregabalin (Lyrica\u00ae).Primidone (Mysoline\u00ae).Rufinamide (Banzel\u00ae).Stiripentol (Diacomit\u00ae).Tiagabine (Gabitril\u00ae).Topiramate (Topamax\u00ae, Topiragen\u00ae).Valproate products: Valproate sodium (Depacon\u00ae), divalproex sodium (Depakote\u00ae), valproic acid (Depakene\u00ae and Stavzor\u00ae).Vigabatrin (Sabril\u00ae).Zonisamide (Zonegran\u00ae).All of these medications have specific uses based on:The type(s) of seizures you experience, such as focal seizures or absence seizures.The underlying condition causing the seizures, such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome.Your age.Healthcare providers also break antiseizure medications into two general groups:Broad-spectrum antiseizure medications: These medications treat a wide variety of seizure types. Providers generally prescribe these first if they\u2019re uncertain of your seizure type. Some broad-spectrum antiseizure medications include levetiracetam, lamotrigine, zonisamide and topiramate.Narrow-spectrum antiseizure medications: These medications mainly treat focal or partial seizures. Some narrow-spectrum antiseizure medications include ethosuximide, pregabalin, gabapentin and carbamazepine.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is an antiseizure medication used for?Healthcare providers prescribe antiseizure medications to treat epilepsy and symptomatic seizures. They also prescribe these medications to prevent and/or treat seizures that happen during or following brain surgery.Providers may prescribe antiseizure medications for other non-seizure-related conditions. Some antiseizure medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other conditions. Providers may also prescribe antiseizure medications for a condition even though they\u2019re not FDA-approved for that condition. This is considered an off-label use of the medication. Certain antiseizure medications may help treat:Anxiety.Migraine headaches.Bipolar disorder.Neuropathic pain.Fibromyalgia.Restless leg syndrome.Parkinson\u2019s disease.Some providers prescribe zonisamide or topiramate to aid in weight loss.Procedure DetailsHow do antiseizure medications work?In general, antiseizure medications work by controlling abnormal electrical activity in your brain. There are many different types of antiseizure medications, and they do this in different ways.Your brain contains billions of cells known as neurons. Neurons transmit and relay chemical and electrical signals to each other. At any given time, neurons can be resting or exciting (triggering) or inhibiting (blocking) other neurons.Seizures happen when a malfunction causes neurons to fire electrical signals uncontrollably. That causes a domino effect, meaning more and more neurons become involved in generating abnormal electrical discharges.Antiseizure medications work in different ways to either reduce excitation or promote inhibition of processes that result in electrical signals. Specifically, they can act by:Changing electrical activity in neurons by affecting ion (sodium, potassium, calcium and/or chloride) channels.Changing chemical transmission between neurons by affecting neurotransmitters (like GABA).Researchers don\u2019t know precisely how some antiseizure medications work.AdvertisementHow long will I need to take an antiseizure medication?How long you\u2019ll need to take an antiseizure medication depends on your unique situation and why you\u2019re taking it.If you have epilepsy and become seizure-free after taking antiseizure medications, the possibility of coming off antiseizure medications depends on a number of factors, including:The type of epilepsy you have.The number of antiseizure medications you\u2019re taking.How long you\u2019ve been seizure-free.When you first developed epilepsy.How long you had epilepsy before becoming seizure-free.The number of seizures you\u2019ve had prior to becoming seizure-free.Whether you have other neurological conditions.The presence of abnormal EEG findings.If you\u2019ve undergone epilepsy surgery.Together, you and your healthcare provider will decide what\u2019s best for you.Care at Cleveland ClinicEpilepsy and Seizures TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the side effects of antiseizure medications?Each type of antiseizure medication and each brand has different possible side effects.

This is because they can affect liver enzymes \u2014 either making too many or blocking their production. This can affect how your body metabolizes (uses) other medications you\u2019re taking.Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all the medications you\u2019re taking before starting an antiseizure medication, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medications and supplements. In addition, if you\u2019re already taking an antiseizure medication, make sure you tell your provider before starting any new medications.ToxicityAntiseizure medication toxicity can happen if you take too much of the medication at once \u2014 accidentally or knowingly.Symptoms include:Confusion.Nystagmus.Ataxia.Slow and shallow breathing (respiratory depression).Certain antiseizure medications can also cause dysrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).Antiseizure medication toxicity is a medical emergency. Call 911 or get to the nearest emergency room if you or a loved one have these symptoms.

Stopping antiseizure medications can result in breakthrough seizures and status epilepticus, which can be harmful to you and the developing fetus.Research is lacking on which antiseizure medications are safest during pregnancy. Certain antiseizure medications (such as valproic acid) during pregnancy can result in an increased risk of major congenital malformations and certain cognitive issues.
