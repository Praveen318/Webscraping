Many people have high cholesterol because of:Cholesterol and saturated fat in foods that come from animals (like meat and dairy products) and fried foods (including palm oil products).A lack of exercise.A genetic issue that causes high cholesterol levels.Everyone needs some cholesterol in their bodies, but your liver produces the cholesterol you need. The rest is extra, and that excess can lead to atherosclerosis and slow down blood flow in your blood vessels.What are antihyperlipidemic drugs used for?Antihyperlipidemic drugs help you improve your cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider will discuss your personal risk factors and cholesterol goal. If diet and exercise aren\u2019t enough to reach that goal, they might prescribe medicines. Your provider might discuss using different medications with you to lower your cholesterol, as well, depending on your personal risk factors.What drugs are antihyperlipidemic?Types of cholesterol-lowering drugs include:Statins (Lipitor\u00ae, Crestor\u00ae, Zocor\u00ae and others).PCSK9 inhibitors (Praluent\u00ae, Repatha\u00ae and Leqvio\u00ae).Fibric acid derivatives or fibrates (Tricor\u00ae, Lopid\u00ae, Antara\u00ae and others).Bile acid sequestrants or bile acid resins (Colestid\u00ae, Questran\u00ae, Locholest\u00ae and others).Nicotinic acid or niacin (Niacor\u00ae and Niaspan\u00ae).Selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (Zetia\u00ae and Nexlizet\u00ae).Omega-3 fatty acids and fatty acid esters (Epanova\u00ae, Lovaza\u00ae and others).Adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitors (Nexletol\u00ae and Nexlizet).Your healthcare provider will discuss these options with you and together, you can decide which type of high-cholesterol medication, if any, would be best for you.StatinsStatins are one of the better-known types of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Providers choose these for most people because they work well and are considered first-line treatment for most people with elevated cholesterol. Statins decrease cholesterol by blocking the HMG CoA reductase enzyme that your liver uses to make cholesterol. Providers may also use the name HMG CoA reductase inhibitors when talking about statins.Statins also:Improve the function of the lining of your blood vessels.Reduce inflammation (swelling) and damage in your blood vessels.Reduce the risk of blood clots by stopping platelets from sticking together.Make plaques (fatty deposits) less likely to break away and cause damage.These extra benefits help prevent cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease in people who\u2019ve had events like heart attacks and in people who are at risk.PCSK9 inhibitorsPCSK9 inhibitors attach to a particular liver cell surface protein, which results in lowered LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol. You can take this class of drug with statins. A provider can inject PCSK9 inhibitors for you. They\u2019re usually for people at high risk of heart disease who haven\u2019t been able to lower their cholesterol enough in other ways.Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates)Fibric acid derivatives are antihyperlipidemics that reduce blood lipid (fat) levels, especially triglycerides. Your body creates triglycerides (fats) from food when you consume calories but don\u2019t burn them.Fibric acid derivatives may also increase the level of HDL, the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol, while lowering liver production of LDL, the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. People who have severe kidney disease or liver disease shouldn\u2019t take fibrates.Bile acid sequestrants (bile acid resins)This class of cholesterol medication works inside your intestine by attaching to bile, a greenish fluid made of cholesterol your liver produces to digest food. The binding process means that less cholesterol is available in your body. Resins decrease LDL cholesterol and give a slight boost to HDL cholesterol levels.Selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe)This class of antihyperlipidemic works in your intestine to stop your body from absorbing cholesterol. These inhibitors reduce LDL cholesterol, but may also reduce triglycerides and increase HDL, or \u201cgood,\u201d cholesterol. You can combine them with statins.Nicotinic acidNicotinic acid, or niacin, is a B-complex vitamin. You can get over-the-counter (OTC) versions of this, but some versions are prescription-only. Niacin decreases LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and increases HDL. If you have gout or severe liver disease, you shouldn\u2019t take niacin.Omega-3 fatty acid esters and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)People often call these antihyperlipidemics fish oils. They use them to lower triglycerides. Some products are available over the counter, while others need a prescription (like ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid). Fish oils might interfere with other medications, and some people are allergic to fish and shellfish. Fish oils aren\u2019t for everyone, so talk to a provider before taking them.Adenosine triphosphate-citric lyase (ACL) inhibitors (bempedoic acid)Bempedoic acid works in your liver to slow down cholesterol production. You should take it with statin medications, but you\u2019ll need to limit your dosage if you take it with simvastatin or pravastatin.How common are antihyperlipidemic medications?Antihyperlipidemic medications are very common, especially statins. Tens of millions of people have taken statins since the first one went on the market in 1987.How do antihyperlipidemics reduce cholesterol?Different kinds of antihyperlipidemics work in various ways, like:Keeping your liver from accessing something it uses to make cholesterol.Stopping your body from absorbing cholesterol.Slowing down or reducing cholesterol production.Helping your liver break down cholesterol.Helping your body make more of the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Your healthcare provider may refer you to a dietitian for help with this. Exercise also helps with cholesterol levels.Medicine can only help you reduce cholesterol if you take it correctly. Here are some tips:Follow your provider\u2019s instructions for taking antihyperlipidemics. Ask questions if anything isn\u2019t clear.Don\u2019t decrease your medication dosage for any reason, including to save money. You need to take the full amount to get the full benefits. If your medicines are too expensive, ask your provider or pharmacist about finding financial assistance. Some companies provide discounts.Fill your prescriptions regularly and don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re out of them to get a refill.Have a routine for taking your medicines at the same time every day. You can use a weekly pillbox, calendar or smartphone app to help you keep track.If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it\u2019s almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Don\u2019t take two doses to make up for the dose you missed.When traveling, keep your medicines with you so you can take them as scheduled. On longer trips, bring extra doses and copies of your prescriptions in case your travel plans change and you need more doses than you planned.Always discuss any new medication with your provider, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal or dietary supplements. They may need to adjust your antihyperlipidemic dose. Make sure you tell your dentist and other providers what medications you\u2019re taking, especially before having surgery with a general anesthetic.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?Contact your provider if you have side effects that don\u2019t get better. They can talk with you about switching to another medicine.AdvertisementAdditional Common QuestionsWhat about using red yeast rice or plant stanols (phytosterols) instead of prescription drugs to lower cholesterol?Many people say they prefer to take \u201cnatural\u201d medicines over prescription drugs. However, just because something is natural doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s safe. The United States doesn\u2019t regulate supplements as closely as medicines. Supplements can also interfere in dangerous ways with medications that you already take.But red yeast rice extract does contain the same chemical that\u2019s in certain prescription statins like lovastatin. In some cases, you and your healthcare provider might agree that you should try the supplement with monitoring.Plant stanols are another nonprescription choice for lowering cholesterol. Plant stanols stop your body from absorbing cholesterol in your intestines. You can buy capsules or get plant stanols in some margarine substitutes.A note from Cleveland ClinicIt\u2019s frustrating to keep seeing high cholesterol levels when you\u2019ve changed your exercise and eating habits.
