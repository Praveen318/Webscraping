Many people undergo nipple reconstruction after a mastectomy. Nipple tattoos heal quicker than surgery and don\u2019t require an anesthetic. The results of all types of nipple reconstruction are permanent.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is nipple reconstruction?Nipple reconstruction procedures rebuild or reshape your nipple, the raised center of your breast, and areola, the dark skin around your nipple. This procedure usually occurs after a mastectomy and breast reconstruction. A mastectomy is a surgery that removes your breast to treat breast cancer. Often, but not always in this procedure, a surgeon will remove your nipple and areolar (connective tissue) as well. Breast reconstruction surgery reshapes and reforms your breast after a mastectomy. Not everyone chooses to get breast reconstruction surgery or nipple reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy.\u00a0AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the types of nipple reconstruction?There are different types of nipple reconstruction depending on what you\u2019d like your breast to look like after the procedure. Types of nipple reconstruction include:Graft: A skin graft is a surgical procedure that moves skin from one part of your body to another. In this case, it moves skin from a donor site on your body to the area of your breast where your \u201cnew\u201d nipple will be. Donor sites may include your abdomen, buttocks or inner thigh. Your plastic surgeon will use the donor skin graft to form and reshape your areola.Flap: A skin flap can be helpful in creating a \u201cnew\u201d nipple that projects after a procedure to remove it. Your surgeon will take a piece of skin (flap) from your newly reshaped breast and then mold, fold and suture your skin flap into the shape of a nipple. After the surgery, you may choose to get injectable fillers to add definition to the shape of your nipple.\u00a0Tattoo: A medical tattoo is pigment added to your skin by a needle. On the one hand, a tattoo can add color to your reconstructed nipple and areola. On the other hand, you can get a nipple tattoo on its own if you choose not to undergo surgery. A tattoo alone (without surgery) uses color and shading to create the illusion of a 3D nipple.While these surgeries recreate the look and shape of your nipple, the feeling in your nipple won\u2019t be the same sensation that you felt before.Who gets nipple reconstruction procedures?You may choose to get a nipple reconstruction procedure if you:Had a mastectomy.Had your breast surgically altered.Experienced an injury to your nipple.Want to cosmetically change the size and shape of your nipple.Each person who considers nipple reconstruction surgery has their own reason why they\u2019re looking to undergo the procedure to meet their personal goals.AdvertisementWhy is nipple reconstruction done?Many people choose to get nipple reconstruction procedures to build their self-confidence. Depending on why you choose this type of treatment, you may not feel comfortable in your skin or being nude, especially if you underwent a procedure that changed your body. If you have a breast cancer diagnosis, you may consider your options as you undergo treatment to remove cancer from your breast. This could involve a mastectomy. Nipple reconstruction is usually one of the final steps of rebuilding the look and shape of your breast after mastectomy treatment.\u00a0Procedure DetailsWhat happens before nipple reconstruction surgery?Before a nipple reconstruction procedure, you\u2019ll meet with a plastic surgeon who\u2019ll provide a consultation.

They\u2019ll learn more about your expected outcomes, which could include the size, shape and color of your tattoo.

Your surgeon or tattoo artist will clean your skin. They could use a stencil that leaves an ink outline on your skin.

Your artist or surgeon can easily move the stencil. Once tattooing starts, you won\u2019t be able to make changes and the results are permanent.You\u2019ll lie with your back on a table and your head on top of a pillow for comfort.

This machine makes a buzzing noise and vibrates. You may feel pin pokes or the sensation of scratching during a tattoo. Your provider will use a clean cloth to wipe away excess ink from your skin in between passes of the needle.
