Specifically, the fascia, a fibrous tissue layer underneath the skin of your palm and fingers, thickens and tightens. This causes your fingers to contract or curl. Your contracted fingers affect your ability to perform such daily tasks as reaching into your pockets, putting gloves on, clapping your hands or holding large objects.Treatment options for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture include surgery (removal of the diseased fascia), injection of collagenase (a drug to dissolve the fascia) and needle aponeurotomy. Unfortunately, there is little benefit from therapy, stretching exercises or cortisone injections (except for the occasional painful palmar nodule). Treatment choice depends on the degree of contracture, joints involved, and number of fingers affected.How does a needle aponeurotomy work?During a needle aponeurotomy, a small needle is used to perforate (make holes in) and weaken the contracted cords of fascia so they can be stretched to allow the fingers to straighten.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat should I expect before a needle aponeurotomy?Your healthcare provider will review pre-treatment steps with you.
