It can help relieve symptoms related to a sinus infection, allergies, a cold or other upper respiratory conditions. Neti pots, rinse bottles and pre-filled containers are all excellent options if you want to try nasal irrigation.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsAdditional DetailsOverviewWhat is nasal irrigation?Nasal irrigation is an at-home treatment to rinse your sinuses. Your sinuses are air-filled, hollow cavities behind the bones in your face. Usually, they remain open so you can breathe easily. If your sinuses become irritated or inflamed, however, mucus (snot) can clog your nasal cavities.With nasal irrigation, you flush away the clog using a saline solution (water and sodium chloride mix) with a neti pot or a rinse bottle. Nasal irrigation thins the mucus that\u2019s causing the clog. It rinses away substances causing the swelling.Which nasal irrigation is best?You can buy the ingredients for nasal irrigation over the counter at most pharmacies or drug stores. All you need is a saline solution and a container to administer it. All containers sold for nasal irrigation purposes work equally well. Choose a container that\u2019s most comfortable for you.Containers include:Neti pots that allow you to pour saline into your nostrils, as if you were pouring tea from a teapot.Rinse bottles that you squeeze into your nostrils.Containers with special applicators that contain a prefilled saline solution.What is nasal irrigation good for?Nasal irrigation clears mucus and flushes out pathogens, allergens or other debris. Pathogens include germs, like bacteria and viruses. Allergens include pollen, mold, dirt, dust and pet dander. When these substances get trapped in your nose, they irritate your sinuses and cause symptoms like:A stuffy or runny nose.Itchy feeling in your nose or sneezing.Trouble breathing.Nasal irrigation can help with symptom relief associated with allergies, sinus infections (sinusitis), colds, flu and COVID-19, among other conditions.Who shouldn\u2019t try nasal irrigation?Nasal irrigation isn\u2019t for everyone. You shouldn\u2019t try nasal irrigation if you:Have an ear infection.Have pressure in one or both ears.Have a nostril that\u2019s completely blocked.Have had surgery on your ears or sinuses.Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about whether nasal irrigation is safe for you.What kind of water can you use to irrigate your nose?It\u2019s essential to use water that doesn\u2019t contain substances that could irritate your sinuses or make you sick. Most water contains trace amounts of minerals, germs, pesticides and other substances. You don\u2019t want to introduce these substances to your sinuses during nasal irrigation.Instead, use:Distilled or sterile water: Distilled water is purified. It\u2019s gone through a process to remove materials that could irritate your nasal passageways and germs that may make you sick. Look for \u201cdistilled\u201d on the water before buying it.Boiled water: Boiling water kills harmful organisms, like bacteria. Boil water for five minutes to ensure you\u2019ve killed all the germs. If you can\u2019t use it immediately, place a lid on the container. Use it within 24 hours.Filtered water: Certain water filters can remove harmful organisms so that water is safe to use. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) offers detailed guidance about which filters are safe for nasal irrigation.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow do you irrigate your nose?First, wash your hands with soap and water. Wash the container if you\u2019re using a neti pot, a nasal rinse bottle or another container that doesn\u2019t contain a prefilled solution. Irrigate over a sink to make cleanup easier.Prepare the nasal irrigation solution. If you\u2019re using a container that was sold with saline powder, follow the instructions to prepare the solution. To make a homemade solution, mix one or two cups of distilled boiled water with \u00bd to \u00bc teaspoon of non-iodized salt. Avoid iodized salt, including table salt. If you\u2019re using boiled water, boil for five minutes.Get the container ready. Pour the saline solution into the container you\u2019ll use to rinse your nose. If you\u2019re using boiled water, wait until it\u2019s lukewarm (not too hot, not too cold) before using it.Get positioned. Lean over the sink, looking down. Turn your head to one side so that one ear is toward the sink (as if you were listening for a sound coming from the drain) and the other is toward the ceiling. Fine-tune your position by thinking of how you want the water to flow. Imagine water flowing from the top nostril and spilling out of the bottom one.Irrigate. Breathe through your mouth. Place the container\u2019s tip or spout inside your top nostril until it forms a gentle seal. Tilt the container or squeeze the bottle so that water flows through your top nostril into your bottom one. You\u2019ll feel the water trickle as it flows downward and spills into the sink. Keep going until the solution is gone.Blow your nose. Breathe air forcefully through your nose to get rid of any remaining solution or mucus. You can blow your nose over the sink or into a tissue.Irrigate your other nostril by repeating these steps on the other side.What should I do when I\u2019m done irrigating?Clean up afterward by throwing away the prefilled container or washing the neti pot or rinse bottle. Check the packaging to see if your container is dishwasher-safe. If it isn\u2019t, you can wash it in the sink and let it air dry on a clean towel.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet ENT (Otolaryngology) CareMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of nasal irrigation?Nasal irrigation is an inexpensive, easy way to relieve unpleasant symptoms related to common upper respiratory infections and allergies.
