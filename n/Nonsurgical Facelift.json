Photo by Cleveland Clinic Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery.How is a nonsurgical facelift performed?Procedures vary depending on the type of nonsurgical facelift you receive. Most procedures take place right in the office. Some are relatively painless, while others may cause discomfort. Your provider can tell you more about what to expect for the following treatments:Botulinum toxin injections: These injections, such as Botox\u00ae and Dysport\u00ae, relax tense muscles that can lead to wrinkles. Most people get botulinum toxin injections between their eyebrows, in their forehead or at the corners of their eyes. Results can last up to three months.Chemical peels: Chemicals remove the top layers of your skin. Chemical peels can help reduce large pores, minimize wrinkles and reveal newer, firmer skin. Most people need multiple chemical peels to achieve the results they want.Dermal fillers: Also called soft tissue fillers, injections of substances such as hyaluronic acid or gel add volume back to sunken areas of the face. Dermal fillers add fullness back to your cheeks and lips. They can also fill in deep wrinkles. These fillers last anywhere from six months to several years.Fat injections: Also called fat grafting, fat injections use fat from elsewhere in your body to fill in sagging areas of your face. Fat injections are more invasive than dermal fillers, as liposuction is necessary to take fat from your body, but they tend to last longer.Laser skin resurfacing: Beams of intense light target certain areas of your face. The treatment removes the older, outer layers of your skin. Heat from the light also stimulates collagen growth. Laser skin resurfacing can help your skin appear smoother and firmer.Microdermabrasion: This minimally invasive procedure gently sands away layers of your skin with a rough pad. Exfoliation with microdermabrasion can help reduce the appearance of fine lines, mild scars and other skin concerns. You may need multiple treatments, usually a few weeks apart. Results last several months.Microneedling: Thin, tiny needles make small wounds in your face. Microneedling stimulates the growth of collagen and elastin in your skin. It can improve the look of loose skin, wrinkles, large pores and sun damage. You may need multiple treatments, usually about three to eight weeks apart. Full results take about three to six months to appear.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dermatology CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of a nonsurgical facelift?The potential risks of a nonsurgical facelift procedure depend on the type you receive.
