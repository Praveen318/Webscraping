It\u2019s a colorless, slightly sweet-smelling gas that you breathe in through a mask or nosepiece.Physicians and dentists have been using nitrous oxide since the mid-19th century \u2014 and it\u2019s still one of the most common inhaled sedatives used today. It\u2019s fast-acting and it wears off quickly, making it an ideal sedation option for short or minor procedures.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat does laughing gas do?Nitrous oxide slows down your nervous system and induces a sense of calm and euphoria. It reduces anxiety and helps you stay comfortable during medical or dental procedures. It doesn\u2019t fully put you to sleep, so you\u2019ll still be able to respond to your provider\u2019s questions or instructions.Despite its name, laughing gas might not make you laugh. (But then again, it could.) Everyone responds a little differently.Nitrous oxide takes effect quickly. Within three to five minutes, you might feel:Calm.Relaxed.Happy.Giggly.Mildly euphoric.Light-headed.Tingling in your arms and legs.Heaviness, like you\u2019re sinking deeper into the exam chair or table.Who shouldn\u2019t use nitrous oxide sedation?Laughing gas is a safe medical and dental sedation option for most people, from children to adults. But it might not be right for kids under the age of 2 and those with:Certain respiratory conditions, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Stuffy nose (nasal congestion).Vitamin B12 deficiency.Severe psychiatric conditions.Ask your healthcare provider whether you\u2019re a candidate for nitrous oxide sedation.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat should I expect if I\u2019m getting laughing gas?Your healthcare provider will talk with you and answer any questions before your procedure. They\u2019ll ask you to sign a consent form so you can receive nitrous oxide.When it\u2019s time for your procedure, your provider will:Place a mask over your nose and mouth. (If you\u2019re getting laughing gas at your dentist\u2019s office, they\u2019ll give you a smaller mask that only covers your nose.)Open a tank valve to allow nitrous oxide and oxygen to flow into your mask. (They\u2019ll start with a very low dose to see how you respond.)Adjust the dosage until you feel the desired effects.Do your procedure. (In many cases, your provider will also give you local anesthesia before beginning. This is because nitrous oxide reduces pain but won\u2019t totally eliminate it. So, it\u2019s common to combine it with other forms of anesthesia.)Stop the flow of laughing gas once your procedure is over.Ask you to breathe in pure oxygen through your mask until you feel alert again.Remove the mask from your face.Monitor you for a few minutes before releasing you to go home.It\u2019s normal to feel a little nervous if you\u2019ve never had laughing gas before. The good news is that you\u2019ll be able to tell your provider if you develop undesirable side effects. If you start to feel dizzy or nauseous, your provider can simply adjust the dosage until it feels comfortable to you.How long does laughing gas last?The effects of nitrous oxide last until your provider turns off the gas flow. Once this happens, it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the sedative to leave your system and for your headspace to return to normal. Due to the short-acting nature of nitrous oxide, you can drive shortly after your procedure.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of nitrous oxide?The most notable advantage of laughing gas is that it relieves anxiety.
