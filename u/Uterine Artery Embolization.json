In addition to fibroids, UAE can also treat heavy bleeding in emergency situations due to trauma, malignant (cancerous) gynecological tumors or postpartum hemorrhage.The terms uterine artery embolization and uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) are often used interchangeably. However, they\u2019re different. UFE is a particular kind of UAE that treats uterine fibroids. UAE treats uterine fibroids as well as several other conditions that may cause vaginal bleeding.Why is uterine artery embolization (UAE) treatment done?The most common reason people need uterine artery embolization is to treat uterine fibroid tumors that are causing symptoms such as:Heavy menstrual bleeding.Pelvic pressure.Constipation.Painful intercourse.Frequent urination.Your healthcare provider may recommend UAE for other conditions like excessive bleeding after childbirth, trauma or cancerous tumors.Uterine artery embolization (UAE) shouldn\u2019t be performed if you:Have uterine fibroids without symptoms.Are pregnant.Have a pelvic infection.Have a disease that affects your veins, arteries and blood vessels.Have an allergic reaction to contrast dyes (used for UAE).How does uterine artery embolization (UAE) work?In UAE, tiny particles (like grains of sand) are injected into the blood vessels leading to your uterus. These particles are guided into your uterine arteries through a thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) using fluoroscopy, a form of X-ray that captures moving images. When uterine blood vessels are blocked by these particles:Your provider can control excessive bleeding.Tumors or fibroids shrink because their blood supply is cut off.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a uterine artery embolization (UAE)?Your healthcare provider will recommend UAE after a thorough medical history and evaluation. They\u2019ll perform diagnostic tests to determine the source of your symptoms.Some of the things that may happen before the procedure include:Your provider will review your health history, allergies, medications and menstrual history. You\u2019ll also discuss your plans for pregnancy, as UAE could affect your ability to get pregnant.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hysteroscopy or ultrasound of your uterus will help your provider determine the cause of the bleeding.A biopsy (tissue sampling) of the inner lining of your uterus may be taken to determine if cancer cells are present.Before UAE, your provider will ask you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and blood thinners.No eating or drinking is permitted before the procedure. Your provider will discuss exact fasting instructions with you.What happens during uterine artery embolization (UAE)?Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is typically an outpatient procedure that doesn\u2019t require a hospital stay. The entire procedure usually takes about 90 minutes.UAE is usually performed this way:An interventional radiologist performs the procedure. Interventional radiologists perform minimally invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance.You\u2019ll lie down on an exam table and get hooked up to machines that monitor your vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure.An anesthetic (pain blocker) is applied to the skin around your groin to numb the area.You receive fluids and sedative medication through an intravenous (IV) line. The sedative relaxes you and may make you sleepy.A tiny puncture is made in your skin near your groin (in your femoral artery), and a thin needle is placed inside.An X-ray (fluoroscopy) and contrast dyes are used to guide a catheter to your uterine arteries. The dye glows under X-ray to show your provider the path of your arteries and how blood flows to your uterus.Once in place, the catheter delivers particles called embolic agents (typically made of gelatin or plastic) that will block blood flow from the arteries to your uterus.When finished, the catheter is removed. Any bleeding from the puncture location is controlled, and a bandage is applied.AdvertisementWhat happens after a uterine artery embolization (UAE)?Most people can leave the hospital within a few hours after a uterine artery embolization (UAE). Some other things to expect afterward include:You may be asked to lie down for several hours after the procedure.Your provider may prescribe pain medication and antibiotics to take at home.You can expect watery or mucus-like discharge for several weeks.Moderate to severe pelvic cramps are common for the first 24 hours after UAE.Most people can resume normal activities within one to two weeks after the procedure.You may not get your menstrual period for several cycles.

Some people pass fibroid tissue through their vaginas. Most people have complete relief after six months.How painful is uterine artery embolization (UAE)?You will be very relaxed and sleepy during the procedure and shouldn\u2019t feel pain.

For uterine artery embolization (UAE), the risks include:Infection: Inserting a catheter could damage other blood vessels in the area or cause an infection.Injury to healthy tissue: The embolic agent could be deposited in the wrong blood vessel, cutting off blood supply to healthy tissue.Allergic reaction: An allergic reaction to X-ray contrast dyes or sedative medications could occur.Loss of menstrual period: In about 1% to 5% of people, menstrual cycles will shut down permanently following uterine artery embolization.Surgery is unsuccessful: Your symptoms may return and a second UAE or hysterectomy is needed.Infertility: You lose the ability to get pregnant.Is uterine artery embolization (UAE) safe?Yes, uterine artery embolization is a safe procedure in most cases.

A second round of UAE may be needed to treat your symptoms if your fibroids return.Can I get pregnant after uterine artery embolization (UAE)?There have been cases of healthy pregnancies after UAE, but the data is limited.
