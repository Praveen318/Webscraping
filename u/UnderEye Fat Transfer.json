Dermal, or dermis, means skin. Healthcare providers inject dermal fillers (also called facial fillers) to plump up skin that\u2019s losing volume due to aging. Fillers also smooth away fine lines and wrinkles, making them less noticeable.What\u2019s the difference between a fat transfer and dermal fillers?Most dermal fillers are lab-made substances. These off-the-shelf dermal fillers are ready to use. They\u2019re a nonsurgical cosmetic treatment. A fat transfer is a natural dermal filler that uses your body\u2019s fat cells.There are more steps when you choose a fat injection over an off-the-shelf dermal filler. The procedure starts with liposuction (a type of cosmetic surgery) to remove fat cells from certain areas of your body. After purifying the fat cells, your healthcare provider then injects the cells into the area below your eyes. Having liposuction increases your risk for problems and makes for a longer recovery than getting a lab-made dermal filler. It\u2019s also uncommon for healthcare providers to harvest enough fat to perform an under-eye transfer.AdvertisementWho gets under-eye fat transfers?An estimated 3 million Americans get some type of dermal filler each year. You may want an under-eye fat transfer or other dermal filler to:Achieve a more youthful and energetic (less tired) look.Get rid of bags below your eyes.Minimize dark circles under your eyes.Plump sunken hollows under your eyes and cheeks.Reduce the effects of aging like sagging skin and wrinkles.Smooth creases or fine lines around your eyes.Who shouldn\u2019t get an under-eye fat transfer?To get liposuction and an under-eye fat transfer, you need to have enough body fat for the procedure.

Smoking can affect how well your body heals from liposuction and responds to the fat transfer.AdvertisementHow long does an under-eye fat transfer last?Results from an under-eye fat transfer may last a lifetime. It can take up to four months to see the complete results. During this time, the grafted fat reestablishes a new blood supply to help it survive. Because your body absorbs about half of the transferred fat, your healthcare provider will inject a larger volume of fat cells than necessary. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the outcome, they may recommend another fat transfer procedure.What other fat-injection procedures may take place with an under-eye fat transfer?Treating the areas underneath your eyes requires a small amount of fat.

These procedures include:Butt augmentation (Brazilian butt lift).Hand rejuvenation.Fat transfer breast augmentation.Lip augmentation.What surgical cosmetic procedures may take place in addition to an under-eye fat transfer?Depending on your aesthetic goals, your healthcare provider may recommend cosmetic facial surgery.
