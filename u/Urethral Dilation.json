Your urethra is the tube through which urine (pee) flows out of your body. A stricture is a narrow band of scar tissue that can block the flow of pee. Urethral strictures can occur as a result of:Infection.Inflammation.Trauma.No obvious cause.During a urethral dilation, a surgeon (urologist) widens your urethra using long, thin rods (sounds) that gradually get thicker or a balloon they gradually inflate.If your stricture comes back (recurs) after one attempt at dilation, it\u2019ll usually continue to come back even with another dilation. At this point, it\u2019s generally best to move on to a more extensive surgery \u2014 urethroplasty. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to undergo a urethroplasty, you can undergo repeat dilations. But you likely need to continue these at home or with your urologist as the scar tissue will keep coming back.What is a urethrotomy?A urethrotomy is a type of urethral dilation.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow should I prepare for urethral dilation?Before urethral dilation, you\u2019ll meet with your healthcare provider. They\u2019ll evaluate your general health.

Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your risk of bleeding. Your provider will also give you specific directions on when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.
