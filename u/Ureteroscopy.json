There are two ureteroscopy methods to treat a  stone in the ureter. The treatment option depends on the location, size, and composition of the stone in the ureter.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsOverviewWhat is ureteroscopy?Ureteroscopy is an outpatient procedure most commonly done to treat stones in the ureters (the tubes that connect your bladder to your kidneys) or kidney. It may also be used to evaluate and treat other causes of kidney blockage or blood in your urine.Ureteroscopy is done with an ureteroscope, a long, thin tube that has an eyepiece on one end and a tiny lens and a light on the other end. In general, there are two ways to perform ureteroscopy for stones:If the stone is small, your healthcare provider will insert a scope into the ureter to remove the stone. The type of scope used in this procedure will have a small basket at the end of a wire that is run through an extra channel in the ureteroscope. The basket is used to collect the stone.In cases when the stone is larger, your healthcare provider will extend a flexible fiber through the scope up to the stone. With a laser beam shining through the scope, the healthcare provider will break the stone into pieces small enough to be passed out of the body with urine.Based on the location, size, and what the stone is made of, your healthcare provider will determine the best ureteroscopy treatment option for you.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

There is a one in 1000 risk of a major injury that could require an extensive surgery to repair.
