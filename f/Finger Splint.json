It\u2019s used to protect and support your finger after an injury. Healthcare providers sometimes call finger splints finger braces or orthoses.Which type of splint you\u2019ll need to wear (and how long you\u2019ll have to wear it) depends on the injury\u2019s severity. Your healthcare provider will tell you how long you\u2019ll need a splint and if you\u2019ll need any other treatment. They\u2019ll suggest treatments to help your finger heal and regain its usual function.How do finger splints work?A finger splint holds your injured finger in one position. You might see this referred to as immobilization. It\u2019s made of a rigid material like metal or plastic. It also usually has a cushion of foam or padded fabric to prevent pressure sores on your finger while you\u2019re wearing it.Whether you have a bone fracture or a damaged ligament or tendon, your finger needs time to recover before you can use it normally. A finger splint makes sure you don\u2019t put stress on your finger while it heals.Depending on which type of injury you have, a splint will immobilize part or all of your finger. While your finger is in a splint, you won\u2019t be able to move or bend it. This will help it heal. It\u2019ll also help reduce pain and inflammation.Finger splint typesThe type of splint you\u2019ll need depends on your injury. Your healthcare provider will tell you which type of splint you should buy and how to use it.The most common types of finger splints include:Gutter splints: A stiff material (usually metal or plastic) shaped like a U or half a circle that runs under and around your finger. Your finger fits into the gutter splint and is supported from the sides and the palmar side (the same side your palm is on).Ulnar gutter splints: These are a variation of gutter splint that starts at your forearm, covers your wrist and wraps around your ring and pinkie fingers.Two-finger splints: Your injured finger is surrounded with metal or plastic, then taped or bandaged to the finger next to it. You might see two-finger splints referred to as buddy splints.Stack splints: Stack splints fit over the end of your injured finger and cover the tip, the palmar side and the sides of your finger.Dynamic splints: A frame that might have a spring or hinged joint surrounds your finger on the palmar side and sides. Dynamic splints let you move your finger with support (in the same way you can move your knee while wearing a knee brace). They can be helpful if your provider recommends stretches or movements as part of your recovery.Thumb spica splints: Spica splints start at your forearm, cover your wrist and wrap around your thumb.What conditions do finger splints treat?Some of the most common conditions finger splints treat include:Mallet finger.Sprained fingers.Some types of broken fingers.Finger dislocations.Osteoarthritis.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of finger splints?Finger splints are easier to apply and remove than other forms of immobilization (like casts). They\u2019re also adjustable, usually with Velcro\u00ae, fabric straps or tape. This is especially helpful if your finger is swollen right after the injury.They\u2019re usually smaller and take up less space on your hand or wrist than casts, which should make it slightly easier to go through your daily routine. If your provider says it\u2019s safe, you can remove a splint when you\u2019re showering or bathing.Wear your splint as often as your provider suggests. This will help your injury heal correctly and as quickly as possible.Finger splints vs castsCasts and splints are both devices healthcare providers use for immobilization after injuries.Casts usually provide more support and protection than splints. They\u2019re usually made from plaster or fiberglass and are custom-molded to the shape of your injured body part. It\u2019s rare to need a cast for an injured finger, but you might need a cast if you break a bone in your hand or wrist.Splints usually provide less support than casts, but are easier to use. They\u2019re typically pre-made devices that aren\u2019t custom fit to your finger or body \u2014 your provider might recommend a custom-fitted splint, but it\u2019s less common. You can buy splints over the counter (OTC) at pharmacies or retail stores. They can be adjusted or removed (if your provider says it\u2019s safe).What are the risks of using finger splints?Finger splints have very few risks.
