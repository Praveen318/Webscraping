Another name for a Foley catheter is an indwelling urinary catheter.It consists of a thin, flexible rubber or plastic tube that goes through your urethra into your bladder. There are two separate pathways (channels) that run the entire length of the tube. One pathway is a drainage port. It allows pee to drain from your bladder into a collection bag.

The full balloon holds the Foley catheter in place in your bladder.While you\u2019re awake, the catheter connects to a collection bag that attaches to your leg.
