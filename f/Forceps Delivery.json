Obstetrical forceps are used to grasp the baby inside the birth canal and help guide them out. When successful, they can help birthing parents avoid a c-section.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookOverviewWhat is forceps delivery?Forceps delivery is a kind of assisted vaginal delivery, a way that your healthcare team can assist you when labor has stalled. It\u2019s only used when vaginal delivery is in its final stages but not progressing, and when you or your baby\u2019s health are at risk from prolonged labor. Forceps are a medical tool that looks like metal salad tongs. A trained healthcare provider can use the forceps to grasp your baby inside the birth canal and help guide them out. While forceps delivery isn\u2019t common, it is a useful solution under certain conditions that can help you get your baby out without requiring a cesarean (c-section).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat causes forceps to be used during delivery?When labor is stalled in the second stage \u2014 the pushing stage \u2014 and pushing isn\u2019t working, your healthcare team will carefully monitor you and your baby\u2019s condition. If you have a health condition that makes pushing more stressful or more dangerous, they might want to limit how much pushing you do. If your baby\u2019s heart rate indicates that they\u2019re under stress from labor, your provider might want to limit the stress on the baby. Certain heart rate patterns may indicate that the baby isn\u2019t getting enough oxygen in the birth canal. When this is the case, your team will want to get them out right away.When conditions determine that you need help to deliver your baby safely, there are a few different procedures that your healthcare team can turn to. Forceps delivery and vacuum extraction are two options that can help you deliver vaginally before resorting to surgery. Certain conditions have to be met for these solutions to work \u2014 for example, your baby has to be at least halfway through the birth canal and your team has to be able to tell what position they\u2019re in. If assisted vaginal delivery isn\u2019t an option, or if it fails, your team may recommend a c-section instead.Why choose forceps vs. vacuum?Forceps delivery and vacuum extraction are similar in their risks and benefits. Often the choice between them comes down to the training and experience of your healthcare provider. Forceps delivery is the less common option because it requires more skill and many healthcare providers aren\u2019t adequately trained to use them. But there are some instances where forceps can work and vacuum extraction can\u2019t. While vacuum extraction requires your baby to be head-first and not rotated, forceps can deliver a breech baby (feet first). Forceps can be used to help rotate your baby into a better position for delivery. They also have a higher overall success rate than vacuum extraction.AdvertisementHow common is forceps delivery?In the U.S., forceps delivery accounts for only .5% of vaginal births. Vacuum-assisted delivery accounts for 2.6%. Forceps delivery rates have been falling in favor of vacuum extraction, partly because of a lack of training in forceps, and partly because forceps are associated with a greater need for anesthesia. Overall, assisted vaginal birth rates have been falling in recent years, while c-section rates have risen steadily to nearly 30% of all births. Some healthcare providers are concerned by these numbers and advocate a return to assisted vaginal delivery methods to avoid unnecessary c-sections.Procedure DetailsWhat are the prerequisites for forceps delivery?Forceps might be indicated if:Your healthcare provider is trained and experienced in forceps use.You have been laboring unsuccessfully for a prescribed length of time (one to four hours, depending on your health conditions).Your baby has descended to the halfway point in the birth canal, where it can be accessed.Your baby\u2019s heart rate indicates it is in fetal distress and needs to be delivered soon.AdvertisementWhat are the contraindications for forceps delivery?Forceps are considered unsafe if:You aren\u2019t fully dilated.Your baby is more than six weeks premature.Your baby has a bleeding or bone disorder.Your baby is leading with their arms through the birth canal.Your baby\u2019s position can\u2019t be determined.Your baby looks like they might not fit through the birth canal.How will I be prepared for forceps delivery?Forceps delivery requires informed consent. If you haven\u2019t already discussed contingency plans with your healthcare team, they will explain the risks and benefits and ask for your consent before they proceed. Then they will offer you pain medication if you haven\u2019t had it already.To prepare, they\u2019ll break your water if it hasn\u2019t broken and drain your bladder with a catheter if needed. This helps make more room in the birth canal. In some cases, they may want to perform an episiotomy \u2014 a surgical incision of your perineum \u2014 to make more room for the forceps.How are forceps used during delivery?While they might remind you of a kitchen utensil, delivery forceps are ergonomically designed for both you and your baby. The blades are curved at the ends to cradle the shape of your baby\u2019s head and curved along their length to accommodate the shape of your pelvis. There are also different types of forceps to accommodate different circumstances, including breech and rotated babies. Your delivery assistant will select the right ones for your baby.For the procedure, you\u2019ll lie on your back with your legs spread apart. You\u2019ll continue pushing with your contractions and resting in between. Your delivery assistant will use the rest period between contractions to place the forceps, one blade at a time, on either side of your baby\u2019s head (or feet). They'll use your next contraction to apply gentle traction to the forceps to help guide your baby out, using mostly the force of your pushing. If your baby needs to be rotated into a better position for delivery, they will work on this between contractions.Forceps are only used as long as they\u2019re helping. If rotating your baby is all the help your baby needs, your delivery assistant will release the forceps. If your baby just needs help getting the widest part of their head through, your delivery assistant will release the forceps after that. Most forceps deliveries progress with one or two pulls and are completed in three or four. If the forceps don\u2019t appear to be helping your baby progress, your delivery assistant will abandon them.What happens after a forceps delivery?If the forceps are successful, you\u2019ll complete your delivery normally. If they aren\u2019t successful, your healthcare team may recommend a c-section to help deliver your baby.Once your baby has been delivered, your healthcare team will check you and your baby out for any wounds resulting from delivery. If you have a tear or an incision to repair, they\u2019ll stitch you up.Over the next several hours, they\u2019ll continue to monitor your baby for any signs of complications from the procedure. If no symptoms present, you\u2019ll be able to take your baby home.Risks / BenefitsIs forceps delivery safe?Childbirth always carries some risk. It\u2019s your healthcare team\u2019s job to minimize that risk for you and your baby. If they recommend an intervention like forceps delivery, it\u2019s because they believe the risks of not intervening are greater. Not intervening could mean that you or your baby sustain serious injury during prolonged labor, particularly if your baby\u2019s heart rate indicates they\u2019re lacking adequate oxygen. The side effects of oxygen deprivation are greater than those of forceps delivery. If labor continues not to progress, you could end up needing an emergency c-section, which also carries a greater risk of complications than forceps delivery does.What are the risks or complications of forceps delivery?Risks to the birthing parent from forceps delivery are the same risks that come with unassisted vaginal childbirth. They can be more common with forceps delivery. Risks include:Vaginal tears. Tears are more common with forceps.Tears of the muscle or wall of the rectum. Also called third or fourth degree tears, these occur in about 10% of forceps deliveries, compared with 3% of unassisted deliveries.Difficulty urinating or urinary incontinence after delivery. This risk increases with the risk of tears.Pelvic organ prolapse. While this is also common after unassisted delivery, this risk increases with the risk of perineal tears.Risks to the baby from forceps delivery are mostly mild and temporary. Serious complications are very rare. Risks include:Surface wounds to the head or face. These heal within a few days.Temporary facial nerve palsy. Damage to the nerves in the baby\u2019s face can produce temporary muscle weakness and drooping of the face. It heals within a few weeks.Skull fracture. Newborn skulls are soft and easier to injure. Most fractures are small, heal on their own and cause no long-term damage.Bleeding within the skull. Brain bleeds are rare, but they can be serious. Your healthcare team will monitor your baby for any sign of internal bleeding after delivery.Recovery and OutlookHow long does it take to recover from forceps delivery?You may spend a little longer in the hospital after a forceps delivery, but recovery time is about the same as it is for an unassisted birth. It usually takes about six weeks, occasionally longer if you\u2019re healing from severe tears. If you have stiches, they\u2019ll dissolve in about a month. You might have to wear a pad for normal vaginal bleeding. If you have residual pain, you should be able to manage it with over-the-counter medications. If it\u2019s more severe than that, consult your healthcare provider.A note from Cleveland ClinicForceps deliveries are rare, but they can be helpful under certain circumstances. You may not plan on having an assisted birth, but labor doesn\u2019t always go according to plan. If you want to make informed decisions about how to proceed if things get tricky, talk to your delivery team in advance. It\u2019s always easier to think about contingency plans when you aren\u2019t in the middle of labor. Ask your team:If they\u2019re trained or experienced in vacuum extraction or forceps delivery.If they have a preference between the two.How they might try to prevent an assisted birth.What are the risks and benefits of forceps delivery?Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/12/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
