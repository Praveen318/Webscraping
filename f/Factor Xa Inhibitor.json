Before factor Xa inhibitors, many people took warfarin (Coumadin\u00ae or Jantoven\u00ae). Warfarin is an effective medication that healthcare providers have prescribed for many years.However, your provider has to adjust your dose based on the results of regular blood tests that check how long it takes your blood to clot. You may need to take these tests anywhere from once a month to twice a week.Frequent blood testing with warfarin is the major difference between warfarin and a factor Xa inhibitor.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
