Most children assigned male at birth (AMAB) are born with a foreskin. Some medical experts believe it helps protect your penis and increases sexual pleasure. Others believe that removing the foreskin helps reduce your risk of developing certain conditions, including:Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Genital ulcers.Penile inflammatory disorders, including balanitis.Tight foreskin that you can\u2019t pull back (phimosis).Penile cancer.Foreskin restoration doesn\u2019t restore your original foreskin.

Restoring your foreskin can be empowering.Improve sexual satisfaction. Foreskin may make your glans more sensitive, though there haven\u2019t been many studies to confirm this. As a result, some people believe restoring your foreskin may make sexual intercourse and masturbation more pleasurable.What are the different foreskin restoration techniques?There are two different foreskin restoration techniques:Tissue expansion (stretching). During tissue expansion, you may use your hands, tape, straps, weights (Foreballs ) or a tissue expansion device to pull your penile skin toward the head of your penis. Over time, your skin forms additional skin cells that allow it to stretch and form a new foreskin that covers your glans. Tissue expansion is a gradual process. It may take several years of regular stretching to restore your foreskin fully. There isn\u2019t enough data to confirm whether tissue expansion has good long-term results. Don\u2019t attempt tissue expansion without first talking to a healthcare provider.Surgery. Surgical foreskin restoration involves taking skin from another area of your body and transplanting it to your penis (skin graft).How common is foreskin restoration?There aren\u2019t many healthcare facilities that offer surgical foreskin restoration. If you have questions about foreskin restoration, talk to a primary care physician (PCP), urologist or plastic surgeon.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
