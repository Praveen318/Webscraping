It can be a single injection or a continuous flow of medication.Your femoral nerve is one of the largest nerves in your leg. It runs down the front of your thigh. Your femoral nerve has a motor function to help you move your hips, legs, ankles and feet. It also has a sensory function, helping you feel touch, pain and hot or cold temperatures. A femoral nerve block prevents pain signals from reaching your brain. But it can also temporarily \u201cparalyze\u201d your thigh and hip muscles for as long as the medication\u2019s in effect.Healthcare providers mainly use femoral nerve blocks to provide regional anesthesia for procedures in your thigh or knee regions.Where is a femoral nerve block placed?Healthcare providers inject a femoral nerve block in the middle of your upper thigh near your pelvis. Your femoral nerve comes from the lumbar plexus nerves. These are a collection of nerves that arise from the lumbar \u2014 or lower back \u2014 section of your spinal cord.What muscles are affected by a femoral nerve block?A femoral nerve block can temporarily affect your quad muscles (quadriceps femoris) \u2014 the muscles in front of your thigh \u2014 and hip flexor muscles (the psoas major and iliacus muscles).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat is a femoral nerve block used for?Healthcare providers mainly use femoral nerve blocks for certain surgeries and to provide pain relief for acute (sudden and severe) injuries.Regional anesthesia for surgeriesSurgeons use femoral nerve blocks to provide regional anesthesia for several procedures, including:Quadriceps muscle tear and tendon rupture repairs.Removal of a knee hematoma (pooling of blood under your skin) after total knee replacement (arthroplasty) surgery.Surgery on your patella (kneecap), such as to repair a patella fracture.Quadriceps muscle biopsy.Long saphenous vein stripping (removal or tying off of the saphenous vein).Surgeons may use additional nerve blocks, such as a sciatic block or obturator block, for certain procedures. They may also use general anesthesia.Surgeons also use femoral nerve blocks to manage your pain after major femur (thigh bone) and knee surgeries, such as a total knee replacement. This is usually a continuous nerve block.Pain relief (analgesia)Healthcare providers may use femoral nerve blocks to provide pain relief after you experience certain severe injuries, like:Femur fractures.Hip fractures.Femoral neck fractures (a specific type of intracapsular hip fracture).Patellar injuries.Providers typically perform these blocks in an emergency department. They make it more comfortable for you when providers give physical exams and take X-rays. It also helps relieve pain if your provider needs to reset displaced broken bones (manipulation or closed reduction).Procedure DetailsHow should I prepare for a femoral nerve block?If you\u2019re getting a femoral nerve block for pain relief from an acute injury, you usually don\u2019t have to do anything special to prepare.If you\u2019re getting a femoral nerve block for surgery, your provider will give you specific instructions. For example, you might need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) before the surgery or stop taking certain medications.AdvertisementWhat happens during a femoral nerve block?The process for a femoral nerve block can vary slightly depending on if it\u2019s for acute pain or surgery. It can also vary if it\u2019s a single injection or a continuous flow with a catheter.In general, you can expect the following when you receive a femoral nerve block:You\u2019ll lie on your back on a procedure table.You may receive a mild sedative through an IV line in your arm to help you relax.A provider will measure certain vital signs throughout the procedure, like your blood oxygen level with a pulse oximeter, your heart health with an EKG and your blood pressure.The provider may use imaging guidance, such as ultrasound, to locate your femoral nerve and the exact spot where the injection needs to go. They may also use a nerve stimulator to locate your femoral nerve. This involves inserting a needle connected to a nerve stimulator machine into your nerve. The stimulator sends electrical signals. The provider knows they\u2019ve reached the right nerve when your patella starts twitching.The provider will give you an injection of a local anesthetic to numb the area where you\u2019ll receive the nerve block. You may still feel a pinch or some discomfort as the needle enters your skin.If it\u2019s a single injection, they\u2019ll inject the medication as close to the affected nerve(s) as possible. If it\u2019s a continuous flow of medication, they\u2019ll insert a catheter (a tiny flexible tube) near your nerve and secure it with medical tape on your skin.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Orthopaedic CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of a femoral nerve block?Femoral nerve blocks are often very effective for temporarily blocking pain.For surgeries and acute injuries, a femoral nerve block can provide effective pain relief with a lesser need for opioid medications.
