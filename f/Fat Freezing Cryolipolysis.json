The procedure is designed to reduce localized fat deposits or bulges that do not respond to diet and exercise. It is not intended for people with obesity. The technique has been patented under the name CoolSculpting\u2122.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat areas of the body are best suited for cryolipolysis?The Food and Drug Administration has approved cryolipolysis to treat fat deposits beneath the chin, upper arms, inner and outer thighs, abdomen, hip/flank (\u201clove handles\u201d), upper back (\u201cbrassiere rolls\u201d), lower back, and underneath the buttocks.Procedure DetailsHow is cryolipolysis performed?The procedure can be done in a doctor\u2019s office or outpatient clinic. The size and shape of the fatty deposit is assessed and the area to be treated is outlined with a skin-marking pencil. Patients are awake during the procedure.A handheld device called an applicator is used to freeze the layer of fat cells (adipocytes) underneath the skin. First, a gel pad is applied to the area to protect the skin. Next, the fatty bulge is suctioned or vacuumed into the applicator\u2019s hallow opening. You will feel a tugging or pulling sensation as suction is applied. These sensations, intense cold plus other possible sensations \u2013 tingling, stinging, aching, cramping \u2013 lessen after 5 to 10 minutes as the area becomes numb during the cooling down process. The fat layer is gradually cooled to the target temperature of between 30.2 and 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit.It takes up to one hour to treat an area. After the area is treated, the applicator is removed. The area may be massaged for 2 to 3 minutes to assist with the breakdown of the fat cells.AdvertisementHow are fat cells destroyed?The technique is based on the finding that fat cells are more susceptible to damage from cold temperatures than other cells, such as skin cells. The cold temperature injures the fat cells. The injury triggers an inflammatory response by the body, which results in the death of the fat cells. Macrophages, a type of white blood cells and part of the body\u2019s immune system, is \u201ccalled to the injury location,\u201d to rid the dead fat cells and debris from the body.How much localized fat can one expect to lose from cryolipolysis and when will I start to notice results?Studies have shown an average fat reduction of between 15 and 28 percent at around 4 months after initial treatment. However, you may begin to notice changes as early as 3 weeks after treatment. Dramatic improvement is noticed after about 2 months.Care at Cleveland ClinicPlastic Surgery CareMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of cryolipolysis?There are many advantages to cryolipolysis:No surgical incision is required.It is a low risk procedure. There is no risk of infection.The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis.Patients do not need to be sedated or anesthetized before undergoing the procedure.More than one area of the body may be treated in a single session.Most people can resume their normal daily activities immediately after treatment.The procedure can be performed on people of all ages.There is no damage to nerve fibers, blood vessels, muscles, or lasting damaging to skin in the treatment area.Fat cells that have been damaged or destroyed are permanently removed from the body.Patients may experience an increase in self-esteem due to an improvement in their appearance.What are the disadvantages of cryolipolysis?Disadvantages of cryolipolysis include:The procedure is recommended only for people who are in good general health with no neurologic or orthopaedic problems and who are looking for \u201cspot\u201d fat reduction in specific areas on the body. Cryolipolysis is not recommended for people who have obesity.There is a risk that the skin surface may be irregular/not smooth after healing.More than one session may be needed to achieve a person\u2019s desired results.If more than one treatment sessions is needed, the next session can\u2019t be performed until 6 to 8 weeks after the first session. This is because it can take this long for damaged fat cells to be eliminated from the body.Results are not evident immediately. Since fat cells are removed gradually from the body, it can take 3 to 6 months to achieve optimal results.One rare side effect that may occur is paradoxical adipose hyperplasia. In this rare condition, the size of fat cells increases after cryolipolysis.

A rare condition in which cold temperatures can impede blood flow to the fingers and toes.Cryoglobulinemia. A type of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) caused by abnormal proteins that become solid or gel-like in the presence of cold temperatures. It is associated with blocked blood vessels and other problems.Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. A very rare autoimmune disease in which red blood cells are damaged during exposure to cold.Cold urticaria. A rare condition in which the skin develops red, itchy spots (hives) after exposure to cold temperatures.Cold agglutinin disease. A rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. The condition is often triggered or made worse by cold temperatures.Other conditions that pose a risk includePregnancy or breast-feedingNerve disorders, such as diabetes-related neuropathyInflammatory skin disordersSkin conditions caused by immune system disorders, such as eczema or psoriasisRecovery and OutlookWhat side effects are to be expected immediately after cryolipolysis?Temporary side effects for the areas that are treated may include:Pain or achesStinging or tingling of the skinRednessSwellingSkin discoloration or bruisingSkin sensitivity or numbnessSide effects may persist for a few days to a few weeks after treatment.
