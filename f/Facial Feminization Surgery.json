They preserve healthy hair follicles, so your hair continues to grow. They can also perform hair transplantation, if necessary.Forehead contouring: If you want to reduce the size of the bone just above your eyebrow ridge, a surgeon can remove part of this bone and reshape it to give a smoother appearance.Cheek augmentation: Surgeons can change the shape of your cheeks with silicone implants or fat injections.
