Signs of aging that a facelift can restore include:Relaxed, sagging skin on your face.Deep fold or crease lines between your nose and the corners of your mouth.Facial fat that has fallen or is lacking.Drooping skin on your cheeks and/or jaw (known as jowls).Loose skin and extra fat in your neck that looks like a \u201cdouble chin.\u201dFacelifts are considered cosmetic restorative surgeries and cannot fundamentally change your appearance or stop the aging process. They also can\u2019t treat superficial wrinkles, sun damage or irregularities in your skin color. Facelifts are very individualized surgeries that are unique to each person\u2019s face and their result goals.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the different kinds of facelifts?There are many kinds of facelift surgeries depending on which areas of the face and neck are targeted. Types of facelift surgeries include:Traditional facelift: A traditional facelift surgery involves incisions around your ears, hairline and below your chin. A surgeon separates your skin from the underlying tissues and tightens the muscles and other supporting structures of your face and neck. The surgeon also removes excess fat in your neck and jowls as needed. The surgeon then re-positions your skin over your face in a natural way and removes any excess skin. This surgery is generally recommended for people who want optimal improvement of moderate to significant facial aging.SMAS facelift (SMAS rhytidectomy): A SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system, the muscular layer of your face) facelift targets the lower two-thirds of your face. In this surgical procedure, a surgeon tightens your muscle and trims excess skin and/or fat in your cheeks and lower face. A SMAS facelift is a variation of a traditional facelift.Deep plane facelift: In a deep plane facelift surgery, a surgeon lifts the SMAS (the muscular layer of your face), fat and skin as a single unit. Deep plane lifts generally address multiple areas of your face at the same time.Mid-facelift: A mid-facelift surgery treats the cheek area of your face. A surgeon repositions the fat in your cheek and tightens the skin in your cheek area.Mini-facelift: Mini-facelift surgeries focus on lifting your lower face and neck area. It\u2019s a quicker and less invasive surgery than other facelift surgeries. Surgeons usually recommend mini-facelifts to people who are younger and only have early signs of facial sagging.Cutaneous (skin) facelift: Cutaneous facelifts involve your skin only and usually focus on your neck and lower face.In many cases, people who get a facelift undergo other procedures at the same time as their facelift surgery, including:Blepharoplasty (eyelid lift).Rhinoplasty (nose job).Facial implants.Brow lift.Liquid facelift with injectable dermal fillers.Jawline rejuvenation.Chemical peel.Laser skin resurfacing.Who gets facelifts?In general, you\u2019re a good candidate for facelift surgery if:You\u2019re physically healthy and don\u2019t have a medical condition that affects your body\u2019s ability to heal.You don\u2019t smoke.You\u2019re mentally healthy and have realistic expectations for facelift results.The best candidates for facelift surgery are those patients who have signs of facial aging, but who still have some skin elasticity.
