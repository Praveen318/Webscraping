During the procedure, your surgeon cuts or modifies a frenum (also called frenulum) \u2014 a band of connective tissue that joins two areas. In your mouth, frena (the plural of frenum) can join your lips to your gums or your tongue to the floor of your mouth.You have multiple frena in your mouth. Most of the time, they don\u2019t cause any issues. However, if a frenum is too short or too tight, it can cause oral health problems and may have a negative impact on speech. In babies, it can cause issues with breastfeeding (chestfeeding) and swallowing.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs a frenectomy?Most of the time, frenectomies are performed on babies who are having feeding issues or if there are speech concerns. But sometimes, frenectomies are necessary for adults, too. For example, sometimes a frenum can be so tight that it pulls your gums away from your teeth. A frenectomy frees the band of connective tissue, reducing the risk of gaps, gum recession and other oral health problems.What is the purpose of a frenectomy?There are many reasons why you or your child might need a frenectomy. Your healthcare might recommend this procedure to correct a frenum that\u2019s causing:A lip-tie, which limits lip movement.A tongue-tie, which limits your tongue\u2019s range of motion.Diastema (a gap between your teeth), which may be cosmetically displeasing to some people.Gum recession, which can lead to gingivitis, cavities and mobility.Pain, swelling or tenderness with brushing or oral care.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat are the types of frenectomies?There are two main types of oral frenectomies:Lingual frenectomy: This procedure removes or modifies the band of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the floor of your mouth. Lingual frenectomies are used to correct tongue-ties.Labial frenectomy: Sometimes called a maxillary frenectomy, this procedure removes the band of tissue that connects your upper gums to your front teeth. Labial frenectomies are used to correct lip-ties. It\u2019s important to note that labial frenectomies can be performed on the lower lip, too \u2014 but upper lip frenectomies are more common.What happens before this procedure?Before your frenectomy, your healthcare provider will review your health history.
