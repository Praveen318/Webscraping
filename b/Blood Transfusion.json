A blood bank holds the blood until needed for a transfusion.In some cases, though, people donate blood to directly benefit a friend or loved one. You may also have the chance to bank your own blood for a scheduled surgery.How does a blood transfusion work?The donated blood or blood components are stored in special medical bags until they are needed. Your healthcare provider connects the needed bag of blood to an intravenous line made of tubing. A needle at the end of the tubing is inserted into one of your veins and the blood or blood components begins to be delivered into your circulatory system.AdvertisementWhat can I expect during the transfusion?Before your transfusion, your nurse will:Check your blood pressure, pulse and temperature.Make sure the donor blood type is a match for your blood type.Make sure that the supplied blood is the product ordered by your doctor and is labeled with your name.During your transfusion, your nurse will:Recheck your blood pressure and pulse after 15 minutes.Recheck your blood pressure and pulse at the end of the transfusion.How long does a blood transfusion take?How long a blood transfusion takes depends on many factors, including how much blood and/or blood component you need. Most transfusions take between one and three hours. Talk to your healthcare provider for more specifics about your needs.Risks / BenefitsWhat are blood transfusion risks?The healthcare industry work hard to ensure the safety of blood used in transfusions. Blood banks ask potential donors questions about their health, behavior and travel history. Only the people who pass the blood donor requirements can donate blood. Donated blood is tested according to national guidelines. If there is any question that the blood is not safe, it is thrown away.Even with these precautions, there\u2019s a small chance something will go undetected in the screening process. However, the odds of this happening are very small. For example, your chances of getting certain diseases from a transfusion are:HIV: 1 in 1.5 million donations.Hepatitis C: 1 in 1.2 million donations.Hepatitis B: 1 in 293,000 donations.Bacterial contamination: 1 in 100,000 transfusions.You\u2019re more likely to get struck by lightning than to get a disease from a transfusion. The precautions healthcare workers take have helped make transfusions very safe.What kind of reactions can happen from a blood transfusion?People can react in various ways to blood transfusions. Reactions people experience may include:Breathing troubles.Fevers, chills or rashes.Hemolytic transfusion reaction (your immune system tries to destroy transfused red blood cells).Most people don\u2019t have any of these reactions. When they do happen, they often feel like allergies. If you experience unusual symptoms during a transfusion, tell your healthcare provider. Stopping the transfusion or getting certain medications can provide relief.What are the benefits of a blood transfusion?Blood is important. If you don\u2019t have enough blood or one of the components of blood, you could face a life-threatening situation.
