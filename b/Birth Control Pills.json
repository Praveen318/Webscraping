The pill contains hormones that regulate menstruation, decrease PMS symptoms, lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers, improve acne and treat endometriosis.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsAdditional DetailsOverviewWhat is the birth control pill?The birth control pill is a type of oral contraception that uses hormones to prevent pregnancy. \u201cOral\u201d means you take it by mouth. Contraception is any form of birth control \u2014 any device or method to prevent pregnancy. People call it \u201cthe pill\u201d because it comes in pill form that\u2019s easy to take. For many people, the pill is just one part of their daily routine.Birth control pills prevent pregnancy 99% of the time when you take them every day, exactly as prescribed. Unlike other types of birth control, like condoms, the pill doesn\u2019t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). You\u2019ll need to use additional protection along with the pill to reduce your risk of STIs.What are the types of birth control pills?There are two types of birth control pills. Both contain hormones that keep you from getting pregnant.Combination pills contain estrogen and progestin. This is the most common type.Progestin-only pills are also called \u201cthe minipill.\u201d They may be better if you\u2019re breastfeeding (chestfeeding) or have a history of clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism) or stroke and shouldn\u2019t take estrogen.The morning-after pill is a type of birth control you can take in emergency situations when you\u2019re not using typical birth control, and you\u2019re at risk of pregnancy. Brand names include Plan B One-Step\u00ae and ella\u00ae. The morning-after pill works differently from the birth control pills you take regularly.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyHow effective is the pill?The pill is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy \u2014 but only if you take it every day. Forgetting to take the pill at the scheduled time increases your chances of pregnancy if you\u2019re sexually active. Nine out of every 100 people on the pill have unintended pregnancies each year.Procedure DetailsHow does the birth control pill work?The hormones in birth control pills prevent pregnancy by blocking conception, when sperm fertilizes an egg. They also cause changes in your uterus so that it can\u2019t support a pregnancy while you\u2019re on the pill.Birth control pills:Stop or reduce ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary).Thicken cervical mucus, creating a barrier that prevents sperm from entering your uterus and eventually reaching the egg.Thin the lining of your uterus so that a fertilized egg can\u2019t attach and grow there.AdvertisementWhen should I take birth control pills?Take them exactly as prescribed. The pill comes in different dosing packets \u2014 including 21-day pill packs, 91-day pill packs or even 365 days of pills. Not all pills in a packet are the same. When you take some of them depends on which kind you\u2019re using. You need to take the right pill at the right time.Follow the instructions on the packaging, or ask your provider or pharmacist if you have questions before you start.Combination pillsMost packets contain \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d pills. Active pills contain hormones. Inactive pills, sometimes called placebo pills, don\u2019t have hormones. The inactive, hormone-free pills may be helpful reminders so that you don\u2019t get out of the habit of taking the pill. You can also set reminders, such as an alarm, or use apps that send reminders.Traditional dose packs28-day packs: Take active pills for 21 days and inactive pills for seven days. You\u2019ll bleed on the inactive week. (The bleeding isn\u2019t a period. Instead, it\u2019s your body\u2019s response to not being on the hormones.)21-day packs: Take active pills for 21 days and no pills for seven days. You\u2019ll bleed the week you\u2019re not taking pills. (Set reminders so you don\u2019t forget to start a new pack on day 29.)Extended or continuous dose packs91-day packs: Take active pills for 12 weeks (three months) and inactive pills for seven days. You\u2019ll bleed on the inactive week. (You\u2019ll only bleed four weeks every year.)365-day packs: Take active pills every day. You may have some breakthrough bleeding or no bleeding at all. Amethyst\u2122 is the only birth control pill available as a 365-day pack.Progestin-only pills (minipills)Progestin-only pills contain 28 active pills that you have to take at the same time every day (within a three-hour window) to prevent pregnancy. For example, taking a pill at 7 a.m. Monday and 10:30 a.m. Tuesday (3 and a half hours) puts you at risk of pregnancy if you\u2019re sexually active.A newer form of the minipill called Slynd\u00ae is the exception. You take 24 active pills and then four inactive pills.How soon does the pill work?The pill can take up to a week to start preventing pregnancy. You\u2019ll need to use another form of birth control during the first seven days you\u2019re taking the pill if you\u2019re sexually active.AdvertisementWhat should I do if I miss a pill?Take the missed pill as soon as you remember, and continue taking your usual dose as planned. Use a backup form of birth control until you\u2019ve taken seven days of active pills. It\u2019s helpful to keep package inserts handy. Most give specific instructions on what to do if you miss a pill.Talk to a healthcare provider if you miss several days of the pill. Your provider can discuss pregnancy tests and emergency contraception options.Should I avoid certain medications while taking the pill?Always check with a healthcare provider before starting new medications or herbal supplements. Certain drugs can make the pill less effective, increasing your chances of pregnancy. These include:Antiseizure medications.Herbal supplements, such as St. John\u2019s wort.Medications used to treat HIV.Can I take the pill while breastfeeding?Your healthcare provider may recommend taking the progestin-only pill if you\u2019re breastfeeding (chestfeeding). The combination birth control pill contains estrogen, which can decrease milk production.However, you may switch to an estrogen-containing combination pill once your milk fully comes in.Ask your healthcare provider which option is best for you.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule Birth Control CounselingFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of taking the pill?Birth control pills are some of the most popular forms of contraception.
