PolicyWhat conditions do biguanides treat or manage?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved metformin (the only biguanide) in 1994 for the management of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since then, metformin has become the most widely prescribed oral diabetes medication and first-line therapy for T2D.Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe biguanides for other conditions. This is an off-label, or non-FDA-approved, use of the medication. Non-FDA-approved uses of metformin include:Management of gestational diabetes.Management of prediabetes.Management of Type 1 diabetes.Management of antipsychotic medication-induced weight gain.Treatment and prevention of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Researchers are also studying biguanides for their anticancer effects. Studies show that people taking metformin for diabetes have a significant reduction in their risk of cancer.How common are biguanides?Biguanides (metformin) are a very common medication. In 2020, there were approximately 92 million prescriptions for metformin in the U.S.Procedure DetailsHow do biguanides work?Biguanides lower blood glucose (sugar) levels by decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces and releases into your bloodstream. They also help lower blood glucose levels by making your skeletal muscle tissue more sensitive to insulin so it can absorb glucose for energy. This increases insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin resistance. These bodily changes help manage diabetes.In PCOS, biguanides decreases insulin levels, which then decrease luteinizing hormone and androgen levels. This helps regulate your menstrual cycle (period).AdvertisementHow long will I need to take biguanides?Diabetes is typically a chronic condition (except for gestational diabetes), so you\u2019ll likely take metformin long-term. It\u2019s important to remember that diabetes management involves several strategies, including regular exercise and meal planning. While metformin is effective, it alone can\u2019t treat diabetes.Your healthcare provider will be able to give you more information about how long you\u2019ll take metformin and other strategies to best manage diabetes.Care at Cleveland ClinicAdult Type 2 Diabetes ManagementPediatric Type 2 Diabetes ManagementFind a Doctor and SpecialistsFind a Pediatric Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of biguanides?Biguanides are effective.
