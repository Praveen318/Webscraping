PolicyWho needs a bursa injection?People who have pain from bursitis may need steroid injections to decrease swelling and pain. Bursitis occurs when something irritates the fluid-filled sacs called bursae that cushion joints.Bursae (bur-SEE) are part of the skeletal system. They allow tendons, muscle and bone to move together without friction.Repetitive use, accidents and injuries can lead to irritation of the bursae. Over time, fluid builds up in the sacs. When bursae swell, there\u2019s less room for joints and connective tissue to move. This creates friction and pain in the joint.What do bursa injections treat?There are 160 bursae in the body. Bursitis can affect any of them, although inflammation most commonly occurs in joints that get a lot of repetitive use. Steroid injections treat:Hip (trochanteric) bursitis.Shoulder (subacromial) bursitis.Elbow (olecranon) bursitis.Hamstring or buttocks bursitis.Knee (most commonly pre-patellar) bursitis.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens during a bursa injection?A bursa injection is a relatively quick procedure that often takes less than 10 minutes. You\u2019ll get the injection at your healthcare provider\u2019s office and go home soon after. Your provider may use ultrasound technology to guide the procedure for certain injection sites like the hip, knee or shoulder.During a bursa injection, your provider:Verifies what procedure you need and in what location.Completes appropriate cleaning of the injection site.Applies a local anesthetic to the skin to numb the area.Inserts a thin needle through the skin and into the inflamed bursa sac.Injects medicine into the bursa.You may feel some pressure or discomfort while receiving the injection. If you are getting treatment to more than one bursa, your provider will repeat the steps using a new, sterilized needle for each injection.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Orthopaedic CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential side effects of a bursa injection?The types of side effects or complications vary depending on where you receive the bursa injection.

They are commonly combined with rehabilitation, depending on the body area. Generally, one injection can decrease your pain significantly. However, to keep bursitis from recurring, it\u2019s important to follow your healthcare provider\u2019s advice. You may need to limit activities that irritate the joint or wear a supportive brace or sling. Stretching and strengthening exercises may also help. If your symptoms reoccurred after your joint injection, please discuss them with your healthcare provider. Commonly, inflammation also involves the tendon because it\u2019s close to the bursa in several joints. Your provider may recommend other therapies or surgery if injections haven\u2019t been successful.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 07/21/2021.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
