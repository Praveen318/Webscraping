Providers can use it to treat you if you\u2019re not getting enough oxygen or can\u2019t get rid of carbon dioxide. A machine delivers air through a mask on your face. It uses a lower pressure when you\u2019re exhaling than when you\u2019re inhaling.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewBiPAP uses a higher air pressure when you\u2019re inhaling and a lower one when you\u2019re exhaling.What is BiPAP?Bilevel positive airway pressure (known as BPAP, or more commonly under the trade name, BiPAP) is a machine that helps you breathe. It\u2019s a form of noninvasive ventilation that providers might use if you can breathe on your own but aren\u2019t getting enough oxygen or can\u2019t get rid of carbon dioxide. Unlike invasive mechanical ventilation, which connects to a tube in your throat, BiPAP delivers air through a mask on your face.\u201cPositive airway pressure\u201d means that the device pushes air at a higher pressure into your airway, which includes your nose, mouth and windpipe (trachea). That higher pressure keeps your airway open and can help move air into and out of your lungs.\u201cBilevel\u201d means that it gives you airflow at two different pressures: one for when you\u2019re inhaling and a lower one for when you\u2019re exhaling. These two levels are called inhalation positive airway pressure (IPAP) and exhalation positive airway pressure (EPAP). The machine settings can set the timing of the two pressures (timed) or it can adjust the pressure based on your breathing patterns (automatic).Providers use BiPAP in certain emergency or intensive care situations. Some people also have a BiPAP machine at home for chronic conditions.Why would I need BiPAP?You might use a BiPAP machine if you have certain ongoing conditions or an emergency situation where you need help breathing. Providers can treat the following conditions with BiPAP:Heart failure.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Obstructive and central sleep apnea.Hypercapnic respiratory failure. This happens when carbon dioxide builds up in your blood and you aren\u2019t effectively getting rid of it when you exhale.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat\u2019s the difference between BiPAP and CPAP?CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines give you the same air pressure whether you\u2019re breathing in or out. BiPAP machines adjust the air pressure you get depending on whether you\u2019re inhaling or exhaling. Most people with sleep apnea use CPAP, but in some situations, your provider may recommend a BiPAP machine.Procedure DetailsWhat happens during BiPAP treatment?If a provider is putting you on BiPAP, they\u2019ll:Turn on the BiPAP machine and adjust the settings, if necessary (the adjustment process is also known as \u201ctitration\u201d).Fit the mask over your face. There are different types of masks. Yours might cover just your nose or your nose and mouth. Your provider will adjust the mask so it\u2019s not too tight or too loose.If you have your own BiPAP, you\u2019ll:Set up your machine. This might include putting it on a stable surface, checking the filter, setting up the humidifier and attaching any hoses to the machine and to the mask. Your healthcare or medical equipment provider should instruct you on how to do this.Put on your mask and adjust it according to your provider\u2019s directions. You usually do this sitting up.Turn the machine on.Lay down and readjust your mask as necessary.How long can you stay on BiPAP?There\u2019s no one answer to this question \u2014 how long you\u2019re on BiPAP depends on why you\u2019re on it. Unless you\u2019re treating sleep apnea, most people are only on BiPAP until they can breathe well enough on their own again.BiPAP isn\u2019t life support and doesn\u2019t take over breathing for you entirely like invasive mechanical ventilation does. If you need to be on BiPAP for more than a few days straight, you need to be able to take breaks. This means either breathing without a machine or getting extra oxygen through a small tube (cannula) just under your nose.If you\u2019re on BiPAP for sleep apnea, you can use it at night indefinitely.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of BiPAP?Benefits of BiPAP include:It\u2019s noninvasive. This means it doesn\u2019t need to be inserted inside your body. Noninvasive ventilation has fewer risks than invasive ventilation.It can help to transition you off a life support system.BiPAP is an alternative to CPAP in people with sleep apnea who can\u2019t tolerate, or who aren\u2019t getting better with, CPAP.What are the risks of BiPAP?Risks and drawbacks of BiPAP include:A provider can\u2019t give you BiPAP if you\u2019re not breathing on your own.BiPAP is uncomfortable and you or your loved one might not be able to tolerate it for long periods of time.The mask can make some people feel claustrophobic (trapped or closed-in).Injury to your lungs from too much pressure (this is rare, and some devices or masks have safeguards that prevent this).Low blood pressure (hypotension).Aspiration pneumonia.AdvertisementRecovery and OutlookHow long will it take for me to feel better after starting BiPAP?How long it\u2019ll take to feel better depends on why you\u2019re on a BiPAP machine. If you\u2019re using it for sleep apnea, it can take a few days to a few weeks to feel better. You may feel more rested, have more energy or notice you don\u2019t need to take a nap during the day. COPD flare-ups can last days or weeks, even with BiPAP treatment.Is there anything I can do to make this treatment easier on me?BiPAP can feel uncomfortable and take some getting used to. If a provider is treating you with BiPAP, they may apply your mask in stages \u2014 loosely at first \u2014 so that you have time to get used to the feeling. If you\u2019re using BiPAP at home, there are some things you can do to help you adjust:Get the right kind of mask. Research what kinds of masks are available and which one might be best for you based on how you sleep. Ask your healthcare or medical equipment provider for recommendations.Practice wearing your mask. Try your mask on during the day or a little bit before bedtime with the machine off. Getting used to the feeling while you\u2019re awake can make it easier to fall asleep with it on.Be consistent. If you\u2019re using BiPAP for sleep apnea, make sure you use it every night. Using it on and off will make it harder to get used to. You also won\u2019t see an improvement in your symptoms without consistent use.Use the ramp feature. If your machine has it, the \u201cramp\u201d feature gives you lower air pressure as you\u2019re falling asleep. After you\u2019re asleep, it increases the pressure.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Talk to your provider if you feel like your sleep apnea or COPD isn\u2019t well managed. They can help you figure out what treatment options might work for your specific condition.A note from Cleveland ClinicProviders use BiPAP to treat both emergency situations and chronic conditions. The air pressure levels can help some people manage their conditions better. Reach out to your provider if you want to know more about treatment options for your breathing or heart condition. Talk to them about what\u2019s working for you and what\u2019s not. Together, you can make a plan to help you manage your health in a way that works best for you.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 05/10/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
