To correct a high forehead, your surgeon might recommend the incision follow your frontal hairline. If your hair is longer and will get in the way of the procedure, you may have to trim it. If your hair is shorter, you may want to grow it out to cover any scars.The endoscopic lift involves a few shorter incisions in your scalp. Your surgeon inserts a scope (a thin tube attached to a camera) into one of the incisions to view your tissues and muscles on a screen while using another device inserted in another incision to make the necessary alterations. In this procedure, your surgeon will adjust your tissue with either a temporary or permanent stitch or anchor below your scalp. These anchors are designed to keep your tissue in place. Because the incisions are smaller, this procedure is less invasive. You\u2019ll experience minimal scarring and a shorter recovery time.The limited incision technique is a combination of the classic lift and the endoscopic lift. Your surgeon makes smaller incisions but they won\u2019t use a scope. The procedure doesn\u2019t correct the center of your forehead but it reduces wrinkles at the corners of your eyes (crow\u2019s feet).Your provider will discuss each type of brow lift procedure they recommend to meet your goals to help you choose what\u2019s best.Is there a nonsurgical brow lift?A nonsurgical brow lift procedure uses Botox\u00ae (botulinum toxin) or another brand of injections to smooth out wrinkles on your forehead.
