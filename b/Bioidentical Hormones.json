They are used as treatment for people whose own hormones are low or unbalanced. Some people benefit from bioidentical hormones, but there are risks to treatment.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsOverviewWhat are bioidentical hormones?Bioidentical hormones are processed hormones designed to mimic the hormones made by your body\u2019s glands. Taking bioidentical hormones can help people who experience symptoms of low or unbalanced hormones. This is often the case for people experiencing symptoms of perimenopause or menopause.Hormones are chemicals made by your endocrine glands. They are messengers that tell other parts of your body how and when to work. Hormones affect many systems and functions in your body. Even the slightest imbalance can cause symptoms that interfere with your day. Healthcare providers may recommend hormone replacement therapy as a treatment for these symptoms.Bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT) uses processed hormones that come from plants. Estrogen, progesterone and testosterone are the most commonly used bioidentical hormones.Some prescription forms of bioidentical hormones are premade by drug companies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved certain types of bioidentical hormones. Other forms of bioidentical hormones are custom-made by a pharmacist based on a healthcare provider's prescription. These are compounded (or mixed) bioidentical hormones.The compounded forms have not been tested and approved by the FDA. Though it is often advertised that products that are made from plants are \"natural\" choices, they are altered in a lab so are no longer natural when done with processing.Both the FDA-approved and compounded hormones come in various doses and forms (pills, creams, gels, sprays and vaginal inserts). Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider to find out which type of BHRT is right for you.Conventional hormone therapy vs. bioidentical hormone therapyCompounded bioidentical hormones are advertised as being a safer, more effective, natural and individualized alternative to conventional hormone therapy. However, these claims remain unsupported. Also, the lack of FDA oversight for compounded hormones generates additional risks regarding the purity and safety of compounded bioidentical hormones. Although custom hormone combinations often include blends of the same ingredients found in FDA-approved bioidentical hormones, some include additional hormones. These additional hormones have not had adequate testing and are not included in any FDA-approved products.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho shouldn't take bioidentical hormones?Using any type of hormone therapy is a decision made between you and your healthcare provider after carefully weighing the risks and benefits.
