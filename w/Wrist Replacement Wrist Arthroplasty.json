The replacement part, called a prosthesis, is typically made of metal, with a polyethylene (plastic) spacer. It\u2019s manufactured to work like a normal, healthy wrist. Arthroplasty is the medical term for joint replacement.Your wrist is a complex joint containing many small bones. It connects your hand and forearm (the lower half of your arm, from your elbow to your hand). Your wrist joint is also called your radiocarpal joint.Your wrist joint helps you bend, straighten and rotate your hand. It moves during many everyday activities, such as waving, washing your hair, typing or picking something up. If your joint is severely damaged or stiff, many daily tasks can be painful.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyWhat\u2019s the difference between wrist replacement and wrist fusion?Joint fusion (arthrodesis) is surgery that permanently connects the bones that form a joint. It helps stabilize your joint and reduce pain.After wrist fusion, you aren\u2019t able to move your joint at all. But with wrist arthroplasty, you can still move your joint after surgery. Fusions generally provide excellent lifelong pain relief, without any restriction on lifting or grasping, or impact on types of activities (like the use of a hammer, power tools, or a tennis racquet).Why is wrist replacement surgery done?Wrist replacement is another option used to treat wrist pain from arthritis after all other treatments have failed. First-line, nonsurgical treatments usually include:Changes to your activity.Pain medications (anti-inflammatories and acetaminophen).Wrist splints and topical medications.Physical or occupational therapy.Steroid injections (cortisone).The most common conditions that can lead to wrist pain are:Injury, such as a bone fracture.Arthritis in your wrist, including osteoarthritis (a degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis (an inflammatory disease).Failed wrist fusion.Osteonecrosis, when bone tissue dies because it doesn\u2019t receive enough blood.If all other treatment options fail, wrist arthroplasty can help:Eliminate clicking, cracking or grinding sounds during movement.Maintain range of motion (the distance your wrist joint can flex or extend).Reduce stiffness and swelling.Relieve joint pain.Restore pain-free motion to your wrist, hand and fingers.AdvertisementHow common are wrist replacements?Joint replacement is common in various sites of the body.
