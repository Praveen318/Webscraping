You may know warfarin by its brand names, Coumadin\u00ae and Jantoven\u00ae. Warfarin slows down how quickly your blood clots. This helps keep unwanted clots from forming inside your blood vessels or heart when you have certain medical conditions or don\u2019t walk or move around for a long time.If you have a blood clot, warfarin keeps the clot from getting larger. It also may prevent a piece of the clot from breaking off and traveling to your lungs, brain or heart.Warfarin helps prevent new clots from forming, but it doesn\u2019t dissolve blood clots. With time, a clot may dissolve on its own. A clot that doesn\u2019t dissolve gets in the way of blood flowing through a blood vessel.What is warfarin used for?Warfarin uses include the prevention and/or treatment of:Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a blood clot in a vein that then travels elsewhere.Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that usually happens deep in your leg.Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blood clot that starts in a vein and travels to your lung.Arterial thromboembolism (ATE), a blood clot in an artery.Stroke, a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel in your brain.Heart attack, a blood clot in the arteries that supply blood to your heart.You may take warfarin if you\u2019ve had the above conditions before or if you\u2019re at risk now because:You have atrial fibrillation (Afib), a type of irregular heart rhythm.You had a heart valve replacement to keep blood flowing in the right direction through your heart\u2019s chambers.How common is warfarin?About 2 million people in the United States take warfarin.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow does warfarin work?Warfarin interferes with part of your body\u2019s clot-making process. It stops an enzyme from activating vitamin K. Some of your body\u2019s clotting factors need vitamin K to do their part in the process of making a clot.What is the warfarin dosage?The dose usually ranges from 1 mg (milligram) to 10 mg. Your healthcare provider will prescribe a specific dosage strength. But you may take a different dose based on the results of frequent blood tests.You can buy warfarin as a tablet in many different shapes, sizes and colors. Each tablet color represents a different strength in milligrams. All manufacturers follow the same color code for the different strengths of their tablets, but the size and shape of the tablets may differ from one company to the next.Each tablet has its strength stamped on one side. It also has an indent across the tablet so you can break it in half if your provider adjusts your dose. For example: if your provider prescribes a 5 mg tablet and then changes your dose to 2.5 mg, you should break one of the 5 mg tablets in half and take the half tablet. If you have any questions about your dose of warfarin, contact your provider.What blood tests will I need while I\u2019m on warfarin?A provider will need to check your blood with a prothrombin time (PT or protime) test. They can use these results to calculate the international normalized ratio (INR), which they use to standardize the results across different labs and testing centers. The PT and INR help a provider monitor how well warfarin is working to prevent blood clots. The results tell them if they need to adjust your dose.You can get the blood tests at a lab or anticoagulation clinic, in a medical office or at home. You usually need to do the PT test one or more times a week to once a month if you\u2019ve had stable results. Follow your provider\u2019s instructions for how often you need to get blood tests and when to adjust your daily warfarin dose.Other medications may increase or decrease warfarin\u2019s anticoagulant effect. You might need to get blood tests more often when you stop, start or increase the dose of medications that are likely to affect the way warfarin works. You may need a different dose of warfarin, too. Talk to your healthcare provider who manages your warfarin if you have any changes in your other prescription medications. Even over-the-counter (OTC) medicines may interfere with warfarin.Other information about your blood tests includes:Illness, health status, diet or medication changes can affect how well your blood clots. Tell your healthcare provider about changes in your health, medications (prescription and over-the-counter) or lifestyle so they can adjust your dose.If you\u2019re planning a trip, talk with your provider about using another lab for your blood tests while traveling.AdvertisementWhat do I need to know about taking warfarin?Other instructions for taking warfarin include:Take your dose of warfarin once a day at the same time of day.Take warfarin before or after eating.If you forget to take your dose and remember within eight hours of the time you were supposed to take your dose, take it.
