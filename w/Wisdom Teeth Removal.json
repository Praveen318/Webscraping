Dentists may recommend this treatment to preserve your oral health and protect your other teeth from possible issues in the future.Your wisdom teeth \u2014 also called third molars \u2014 are in the very back of your mouth. Typically, they erupt (grow in) sometime between the ages of 17 and 25.Scientists believe wisdom teeth are vestigial structures (parts of the human body that are no longer necessary). Our ancestors needed these teeth to crush and chew raw leaves, nuts, roots and meat. Today, we eat more cooked food and use forks and knives to cut our food up into smaller pieces. As a result, we don\u2019t really need wisdom teeth anymore.Some people have all four wisdom teeth (one in each quadrant \u2014 the upper left, lower left, upper right and lower right). Others may have one, two, three or none at all. No matter how many wisdom teeth you do (or don\u2019t) have, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something wrong. It\u2019s just a variation of normal and a sign of the ever-changing evolutionary process.Why is this done?You might need wisdom teeth removed if you:Have one or more impacted wisdom teeth. (\u201cImpacted\u201d means partially or fully trapped in your gums or jawbone.)Have wisdom teeth that grew in crooked or sideways.Develop pain near the back of your mouth.Trap food and debris around your wisdom teeth.Develop gum disease, particularly around your molars.Have tooth decay (cavities) in a partially erupted wisdom tooth.Develop a cyst (fluid-filled sac) around one or more wisdom teeth.Have damage to nearby teeth or surrounding bone.In many cases, dentists recommend wisdom teeth extraction as a preventive measure. As a result, your dentist may suggest removing your wisdom teeth even if you don\u2019t have any symptoms. This can help reduce your risk for future problems, including infection and tooth decay.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow should I prepare for wisdom teeth removal?During a consultation with an oral surgeon, they\u2019ll check the health of your wisdom teeth and take dental X-rays to determine their exact location. This is a good time to tell your surgeon about any medications, vitamins or supplements you\u2019re currently taking.Your surgeon will also discuss sedation dentistry options with you during this appointment. Depending on your needs and preferences, they may recommend local anesthesia, nitrous oxide (laughing gas), IV (intravenous, or through your vein) sedation or general anesthesia.If you choose IV sedation or general anesthesia, your surgeon will give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for your appointment. This may include fasting after midnight the night before your surgery and stopping certain medications a few days prior. (Don\u2019t stop taking medication before discussing it with your surgeon.)What happens during wisdom tooth extraction?The day of your procedure, your surgeon will:Give you anesthesia to numb your teeth and gums and keep you comfortable. (If you choose sedation, they\u2019ll give you sedative medications, as well.)Make incisions (cuts) in your gums, if necessary, to expose teeth trapped in your gums or jawbone.Carefully loosen your wisdom tooth and lift it from its socket. (They may need to divide your tooth into sections for easier removal.)Clean the area to make sure there\u2019s no infection.Place stitches to close the surgical site, if necessary.Place gauze over the sockets to slow bleeding.How long does this procedure take?Wisdom tooth extraction usually takes an hour or less. Complex cases may take longer.AdvertisementWhat happens after wisdom teeth removal?After wisdom teeth removal, you can expect mild discomfort, slight bleeding and swelling. Your oral surgeon will give you instructions for wisdom teeth management to ease these side effects.

Replace with clean gauze if necessary. Your surgeon can tell you when to stop using gauze after wisdom tooth extraction. But in general, you can take it out when the bleeding slows. It\u2019s normal to have some oozing, but you shouldn\u2019t have excessive bleeding.Rest as much as you can. You should stay at home and recover for at least three to five days.

Leave it on for 20 minutes, and then take it off for 20 minutes. Repeat several times a day.Keep extraction sites clean. Gently soak the surgical areas with alcohol-free antibacterial mouthwash. Don\u2019t swish. Swishing can dislodge blood clots and cause dry sockets, a painful condition that exposes the bone at your extraction site. Instead, lean your head to each side and let the mouthwash soak the areas.Brush and floss the rest of your teeth every day. While you don\u2019t want to brush over the extraction sites, you\u2019ll still need to keep your other teeth clean during recovery. This reduces your risk for infection.Take all medications as prescribed. Your surgeon will give you medications to keep you comfortable and reduce your risk of infection. Don\u2019t stop taking these medications until your surgeon says it\u2019s OK.DON\u2019T:Drink through a straw. This dislodges blood clots and causes dry sockets.Exercise until your surgeon says it\u2019s OK. Getting your heart rate up increases your risk for pain, bleeding and swelling. Most people can resume their fitness routines in about 48 to 72 hours.Lift heavy things. Heavy lifting also increases your risk for postoperative complications like pain, bleeding and swelling.Eat hard, crunchy or chewy foods. These can damage your healing gums and cause pain.Drink carbonated beverages or beverages containing alcohol. These beverages can dislodge blood clots and cause dry sockets.

At this age, your wisdom teeth are still developing, so they may be easier to extract.A note from Cleveland ClinicWisdom teeth removal is a rite of passage for many teens and young adults.
