This device has a high success rate for protecting people from dangerous heart rhythms.ContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is a cardiac LifeVest?The LifeVest\u2122 is a personal defibrillator children and adults can wear if they\u2019re at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). It monitors your heart all the time. If a life-threatening arrhythmia starts, your LifeVest delivers a shock treatment to restore your heart to a normal rhythm.A LifeVest cardiac device consists of a garment and a monitor you wear all the time except in the shower or bathtub. You wear the lightweight fabric vest under your clothes. Electrodes inside the device pick up your electrocardiogram (EKG). You wear the monitor around your waist (like a fanny pack) or from a shoulder strap. The monitor is about the size of a paperback book.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

If you have ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) or ventricular fibrillation (rapid, uncontrolled, ineffective heartbeat), the device sounds an alarm to verify that you\u2019re not responsive.If you\u2019re conscious, you have less than one minute to respond to the alarms by pressing two buttons to stop the treatment.If you don\u2019t respond to the alarms, the device warns bystanders that you\u2019re about to receive a shock. This warns them not to touch you so they avoid getting hurt.If the arrhythmia continues and you still don\u2019t respond, you\u2019ll get a treatment shock through the garment electrodes. When you\u2019re unconscious, you won\u2019t feel the shock from the LifeVest cardiac device.After the shock, if your heartbeat returns to normal, the alarms stop and the LifeVest returns to its normal monitoring mode.However, if your heartbeat doesn\u2019t return to normal and the arrhythmia continues, the treatment cycle repeats. You can get up to five treatment shocks.How is the LifeVest different from an automated external defibrillator (AED)?An AED requires someone nearby to witness your arrhythmia event (such as ventricular fibrillation). They need to operate an AED and give you the treatment. In order to be effective, you need the shock within a few minutes after your abnormal heart rhythm happens. Your chances of survival drop about 10% for each minute after fibrillation starts, so a bystander must act quickly.With the LifeVest, you don\u2019t need a bystander to help you. The device continuously monitors your EKG. If a lethal arrhythmia happens, the LifeVest delivers a treatment shock typically within one minute. The LifeVest cardiac device protects you even when you\u2019re alone or sleeping. An AED can\u2019t.AdvertisementHow is the LifeVest different from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)?The ICD and the LifeVest provide continuous protection. Your healthcare provider places an ICD under your skin and in your veins, but you wear the LifeVest cardiac device under your clothes. It needs to fit well to have contact with your skin.What is a cardiac LifeVest used for?The LifeVest can provide protection from sudden cardiac arrest for people who are waiting:For an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).For a heart transplant.To see if their condition doesn\u2019t improve and they need an ICD.To get another ICD after an infection or an ICD malfunction.LifeVest is an option for people who:Aren\u2019t candidates for an ICD.Have had a heart attack and have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.Will have or had bypass surgery or stent placement.Have cardiomyopathy.Have heart failure.AdvertisementWhat ejection fraction requires a LifeVest?You may need a LifeVest if your ejection fraction (how well your left ventricle can pump) is less than or equal to 35%. A normal ejection fraction ranges from 55% to 70%.How common are LifeVests?Tens of thousands of people are using LifeVest. The cardiac LifeVest received FDA approval in 2001.How long can you live with a LifeVest?People have worn a LifeVest for as long as about seven years. However, many people wear them for a few weeks or a few months.Risks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of a LifeVest?Advantages of a LifeVest include:Protecting you from sudden cardiac arrest while you wear it.Not needing help from anyone nearby.Giving you a short-term solution until you get an ICD.Keeping EKG recordings for your healthcare provider.What are the risks or complications of a LifeVest?Risks or disadvantages of a cardiac LifeVest include:It doesn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t wear it.You need to be ready to respond to alarms at any time.You can\u2019t wear it while bathing.You need to change the battery every day.People near you risk injuring themselves if they touch you while you\u2019re receiving a shock.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the success rate of the LifeVest?Researchers found the LifeVest had a 99% success rate for treating ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation occurrence. It usually took only one shock to correct an abnormal rhythm.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?Contact your provider when:You awaken after receiving a shock from your LifeVest.You have questions about your LifeVest.Your LifeVest isn\u2019t working normally or fitting right.A note from Cleveland ClinicIf you\u2019re at risk for sudden cardiac arrest, you may get peace of mind from having a wearable defibrillator.
