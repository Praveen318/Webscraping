But they must learn new ways to breathe, speak and swallow.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is a laryngectomy?A laryngectomy is a surgical procedure to remove part or all of your larynx (voice box). Your larynx is above your trachea (windpipe), and it connects your nose and mouth to your lungs. Your larynx helps you speak, breathe and swallow.Why would you need a laryngectomy?You might need laryngectomy surgery if you have:Laryngeal cancer.Laryngeal fracture.Severe larynx damage due to trauma or injury.Chondronecrosis of the larynx (a rare condition in which radiation therapy causes damage to your larynx).Depending on the severity of your condition, your healthcare provider may recommend a partial laryngectomy (removing part of your larynx) or a total laryngectomy (removing all of your larynx).How common are laryngectomies?As of 2013, there were about 60,000 people who had undergone a laryngectomy in the United States. Today, this number is decreasing because fewer people are smoking (a leading cause of laryngeal cancer) and because newer surgical methods can sometimes treat conditions without removing the larynx.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

After making the incision, your surgeon removes either part or all of your larynx. They may also remove some of your lymph nodes and part of your pharynx (throat).Create your stoma. Next, your surgeon creates an opening in your neck and in the front of your windpipe. This opening is a stoma. A laryngectomy tube is then placed in your stoma. This will help you breathe after your surgery.Perform a tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP). In some cases, your surgeon may create a TEP (a small hole between your trachea and esophagus). This allows for the placement of a voice prosthesis. A TEP may not be suitable for everyone. Ask your healthcare provider if it\u2019s an option for you.Close the incision. Finally, your surgeon will close the incision with sutures (stitches).Following a laryngectomy, most people stay in the hospital for one to two weeks.

So, you\u2019ll have to learn new ways to speak and communicate. A speech-language pathologist can help find an approach that works best for you.Voice prosthesisA voice prosthesis (laryngectomy speaking device) sits over your stoma. With training, you can learn to move air from your lungs into your esophagus. The resulting vibrations create speech.There are different types of voice prostheses. Ask your healthcare provider if this option could work for you.ElectrolarynxYou hold an electrolarynx (artificial larynx) against your neck to enhance your speech. Most people can use an electrolarynx after only a few days, making it one of the fastest methods to learn.The words produced by an electrolarynx sound robotic and artificial. But it\u2019s an excellent short- or long-term solution after laryngectomy surgery.Esophageal speechSome people use esophageal speech to communicate after a laryngectomy. With this method, you can redirect air from your mouth, trap it in your throat and esophagus and use it to form speech.Nonverbal communicationAnyone who undergoes a laryngectomy will use nonverbal communication at some point during their recovery.
