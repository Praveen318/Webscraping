As a result, you must be at least 21 years old to get FDA-approved lip fillers.Before your lip filler procedure, you\u2019ll meet with your healthcare provider. They\u2019ll assess many factors, including your mental health and any social conditions. Your healthcare provider may ask the following questions:Why do you want lip fillers?What\u2019re your expectations?Do you think a lot about imagined or very small defects with your body?Is a spouse, partner or friend encouraging you to get lip fillers?Your physical health and the shape of your face are also important.

They\u2019ll also take photographs of your face and lips for your medical record.When considering the size of your lips, it\u2019s important to imagine how you\u2019ll look. Think about getting a new haircut. You may show your hairstylist a photograph to give them an idea of how you\u2019d like your hair to look. However, your hairstylist might tell you that your hair won\u2019t look like the photograph because of your hair texture, hairline, volume or length. You may want your lips to look like a celebrity\u2019s lips, but it might not be achievable because your face shape and features are unique. Ask your healthcare provider if bringing in a picture is helpful. But be prepared to thoroughly describe what you want your lips to look like if your healthcare provider doesn\u2019t want to reference a photograph.What happens during a lip filler procedure?During a lip filler procedure, your healthcare provider will apply a topical anesthetic to your lips. The topical anesthetic will numb your lips so you won\u2019t feel any pain and the process is as comfortable as possible. The numbing creams often consist of benzocaine, lidocaine and tetracaine (BLT). About 15 to 30 minutes later, your lips should be numb.If you have a BLT allergy, your healthcare provider may give you a nerve block injection to numb your lips. About 15 to 30 minutes after the injection, your lips should be numb.Your healthcare provider will then use a thin needle to inject lip filler into any or all parts of your lips, including the edges of your lips (vermillion border), the curve in the center of your upper lip (Cupid\u2019s bow) and your oral commissures (corners of your mouth). You won\u2019t feel any pain, but you may feel a pinching sensation, and your eyes may water. On average, your healthcare provider will insert 1 milliliter (mL) of lip filler into your lips, which is about one-fifth of a teaspoon. The needle won\u2019t go deeper than 2.5 millimeters (mm) into your skin.Your healthcare provider may apply an ice pack to your lips throughout the procedure to minimize swelling and bruising.The entire procedure may take as little as 30 minutes or as long as two hours.What happens after a lip filler procedure?After the procedure is complete, your healthcare provider may gently massage your lips so that they absorb the filler. They may continue to ice your lips as well.Your healthcare provider will monitor you for up to 15 minutes to ensure you don\u2019t experience any side effects, including dizziness, nausea or substantial bleeding. Once they determine that you no longer require monitoring, they\u2019ll let you go home (discharge you). A local anesthetic won\u2019t make you tired or groggy, so you can drive yourself home. However, you may want to have a family member or friend drive you home just in case.Your lips may be swollen, sensitive and bruised. Swelling usually goes away after 24 to 48 hours, but it may take up to a week.Your healthcare provider will also schedule a follow-up appointment about two weeks after the procedure to monitor your lips.
