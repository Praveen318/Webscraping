They can help you plan ahead for a successful recovery.How is abdominoperineal resection surgery performed?This procedure is performed under general anesthesia at a hospital. Abdominoperineal resection steps include:Preparing the sigmoid colon and rectum for removal: Your surgeon will complete several steps before removing the anus, rectum and sigmoid colon. First, the main blood vessels that serve the diseased sections of the bowel are divided. Next, your surgeon frees the sigmoid colon and rectum, then separates the sigmoid colon from the remaining large intestine.Preparing the anus for removal: Your surgeon then operates on the area between the legs (perineal region) to remove the anus. The anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon are removed from the body. The skin is sewn closed where the anus used to be located.Performing a colostomy: Once the anus and rectum are removed, a permanent colostomy is created. A colostomy involves bringing a portion of the colon (large bowel) to an opening at the surface of the skin. This new opening, called a stoma or colostomy, allows waste to pass out of the body. The stoma usually measures from 1 to 1\u00bd inches in diameter. A pouch, or ostomy bag, is worn to collect gas and stool. This pouch is worn at all times since there is no longer conscious control of waste elimination from the body.AdvertisementHow long does abdominoperineal resection surgery take?Generally, abdominoperineal resection surgery takes about two to three hours. This timeframe can vary depending on your specific situation.What should I expect during abdominoperineal resection recovery?Following abdominoperineal resection surgery, most people stay in the hospital for several days.

Your diet is slowly increased from liquids to solid foods as your intestines start functioning.While you are recovering in the hospital, your medical team will give you instructions for abdominoperineal resection postoperative care.
