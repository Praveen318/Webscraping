Some people use this device while waiting for a heart transplant. An LVAD can give you an improved quality of life, but it\u2019s not a cure. Still, more people are getting these devices than before because of improved survival rates with device use.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a left ventricular assist device?A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical pump that providers implant in people who have heart failure. The device helps the lower left chamber (left ventricle) of your heart pump blood out of the ventricle to your aorta and the rest of your body. Because it helps your left ventricle, it\u2019s a left ventricular assist device.This is an important job because your aorta sends oxygen-rich blood to your whole body. You can\u2019t live without a steady supply of oxygen to your cells and tissues.How does a left ventricular assist device work?A left ventricular assist device works by pumping blood from your left ventricle to your aorta. Your aorta is the large artery that takes blood from your heart to the rest of your body.A surgeon implants the left ventricular assist device\u2019s pump unit at the bottom of your heart inside your chest. The device receives blood and sends it through a tube to your aorta.What are the parts of a left ventricular assist device?Parts of a left ventricular assist device include:Pump: Attaches to a driveline (cable) and control system (controller).Driveline: Passes from the device through the skin on your belly (abdomen) to the controller (a small computer) on the outside of your body.Controller: Runs the pump. Messages and alarms from the controller help you operate the system.Power supply: Keeps the LVAD running with rechargeable batteries or a cord that plugs into an electrical outlet. Batteries can provide up to 14 hours of power, depending on the device. When the batteries are low on power, you need to replace them.There are a few different LVADs available. Your healthcare provider will recommend the one that\u2019s best for you based on your needs and medical condition.What does a left ventricular assist device manage?A left ventricular assist device is for people with end-stage heart failure. It\u2019s a bridge to transplant for people waiting for a heart transplant. It can also help people who aren\u2019t candidates for a heart transplant. Healthcare providers call that destination therapy.Bridge to transplant (BTT)While you wait for a heart transplant, your medical condition may continue to get worse. This may lead to hospital admission, increased symptoms and damage to other organs such as your kidneys, liver and lungs.Bridge to transplant (BTT) helps you survive until you can receive a donor\u2019s heart. The LVAD assists your heart and allows you to have a better quality of life and fewer symptoms. A surgeon removes the device at the time of your transplant.The amount of time you receive support from an LVAD until heart transplantation varies and depends on your medical condition, blood type and body size.Destination therapy (DT)Destination therapy (DT) is for people with heart failure who aren\u2019t candidates for heart transplant surgery. Healthcare providers consider this only for people after they\u2019ve tried everything else (like medications, lifestyle changes and heart procedures).A left ventricular assist device supports your heart\u2019s function and improves your quality of life for the rest of your life.Your provider will determine if a left ventricular assist device is an appropriate treatment option for you, based on your medical condition, symptoms, body size and presence of other medical conditions.How common is a left ventricular assist device?Better survival odds with today\u2019s LVAD devices have led to an increase in the number of people who receive the devices. Each year, more than 2,500 people with heart failure receive a left ventricular assist device in the United States.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsHow should I prepare for receiving a left ventricular assist device?Healthcare providers will evaluate you to see if you\u2019re a candidate for a left ventricular assist device. Your medical exam will include several tests:Electrocardiogram.Chest X-ray.Blood tests.Echocardiogram.Metabolic stress test.Heart catheterization.A left ventricular assist device isn\u2019t an appropriate treatment option for everyone with heart failure.

Depending on your situation, the provider may make an incision on the left side of your chest (thoracotomy).Close the incision after putting the left ventricular assist device in place.How long does it take to implant a left ventricular assist device?The procedure to implant a left ventricular assist device takes four to six hours.AdvertisementWhat happens after a left ventricular assist device procedure?Before you leave the hospital, you\u2019ll learn how to manage the device and troubleshoot potential emergencies.
