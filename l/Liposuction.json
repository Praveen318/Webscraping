Different types of liposuction include:Tumescent liposuction: Tumescent liposuction is the most common liposuction procedure. Your surgeon injects a saline (salt water) solution into your fatty areas. The mixture contains medicines such as epinephrine, which shrinks your blood vessels. This solution helps your surgeon remove fat easily and reduces blood loss. Other medications are sometimes included to provide pain relief.Ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL): Your surgeon uses ultrasonic energy via a metal rod placed underneath your skin to liquefy your fat before removing it from your body.Vibration Amplification of Sound Energy at Resonance (VASER): VASER liposuction uses a stainless steel tool (cannula) with grooves and ultrasound waves to easily break up and remove fat cells and fat from your body. This is a type of UAL.Suction-assisted liposuction: Suction-assisted liposuction is a traditional form of liposuction that uses a vacuum to remove fat from your body.Power-assisted liposuction (PAL): Power-assisted liposuction uses a small, stainless steel tool (cannula) that moves back and forth over your fat to break it up. The cannula makes removing fat easier for your surgeon and the procedure is more precise.Laser-assisted liposuction (Smartlipo\u2122 and SlimLipo\u2122): Your healthcare provider will use strong laser lights on a small, flexible tube (fiber) to break down and liquefy your fat to simplify removal.

Your surgeon will move the cannula around inside of your body to break up or liquefy your fat. Then, they\u2019ll remove excess fat with a suction pipe or large syringe. When your surgeon completes the procedure, they\u2019ll close up the incision site with stitches that are either dissolvable or non-dissolvable.Your specific procedure depends on the type of liposuction you\u2019re having.
