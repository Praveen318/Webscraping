They\u2019re used to treat cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and other lung conditions. They come in oral, intravenous (IV) and nebulizer forms.Mucolytics are part of a more general group of medications called mucoactive agents. Mucoactive agents have various ways of removing mucus from your lungs. They might break up mucus, thin it out or allow it to move more easily from your lungs. Other mucoactive agents include expectorants, mucoregulators and mucokinetics.What conditions do mucolytics treat?Providers use mucolytics to treat chronic (long-lasting) lung or breathing conditions that create thick mucus. These include:Cystic fibrosis.Bronchiectasis.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Emphysema.Asthma.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are examples of mucolytic drugs?Acetylcysteine (also called N-acetyl cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine or NAC) and dornase alfa are mucolytic drugs. Brand names include Mucomyst\u00ae and Pulmozyme\u00ae.Both types of mucolytics break apart mucus in your lungs. NAC also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It can also treat an acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) overdose.Dornase alfa isn\u2019t recommended for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.Procedure DetailsHow do mucolytics work?When your lungs are working as they should, mucus traps irritants and infectious particles (like bacteria or viruses). Hairlike structures in your lungs (cilia) help you clear out the mucus \u2014 and all the things trapped in it \u2014 when you cough.But certain chronic lung conditions create a lot of thick, hard-to-clear mucus. This can make it hard to breathe and trap germs in your lungs, causing you to get sick more easily. Mucolytics break apart the molecules that make up mucus, making it thinner and easier to clear out of your lungs.AdvertisementHow do you take mucolytics?You often get a mucolytic as a liquid that you put in a nebulizer machine. You breathe in the medication as a mist. Providers can also give them in an IV into a vein, or you can take them as a pill you swallow.Risks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of mucolytics?If you have a chronic lung condition with thick mucus, mucolytics make it easier to breathe and reduce your risk of infection. People with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis may have a better prognosis when they\u2019re better able to clear their lungs. Providers sometimes use them to treat COPD or emphysema when symptoms get worse (exacerbate).AdvertisementWhat are the risks or side effects of mucolytics?Acetylcysteine can cause bronchospasm, so people with asthma should be careful when taking it. Side effects of mucolytics include:Nausea or vomiting.Diarrhea.Rash.Sore throat.Loss of voice or change in voice.Shortness of breath (dyspnea).Chest pain.And while not harmful, many people notice that acetylcysteine smells very bad.Do mucolytics make you cough more?Mucolytics make it easier to clear mucus out when you cough. They don\u2019t necessarily make you cough more.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?Contact your healthcare provider if you:Have any questions or concerns about mucolytic treatment.Have any unwanted, unexpected or severe side effects to your treatment.Feel like your treatment isn\u2019t working.Additional Common QuestionsWhich is better, mucolytic or expectorant?Mucolytics and expectorants, like guaifenesin (Mucinex\u00ae, Robitussin\u00ae), work in different ways to clear mucus out of your lungs. Mucolytics treat chronic lung or breathing conditions. They usually require a prescription from a provider. Expectorants are more widely available over the counter (OTC) and are usually used to treat more common conditions, like cold and flu symptoms.A note from Cleveland ClinicMucolytics can give you relief from the symptoms of chronic lung diseases and improve your quality of life. Talk to your provider about any questions you have about mucolytic medications. They can address your concerns and recommend treatments for any possible side effects. They\u2019ll work with you to find the treatment that\u2019s the best fit for you.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 04/13/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
