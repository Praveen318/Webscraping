PolicyWhat is the difference between myringotomy and tympanostomy?During a myringotomy, your surgeon creates a tiny hole in your tympanic membrane (eardrum). In some cases, your surgeon may also perform a companion procedure called a tympanostomy. During tympanostomy, your surgeon places an ear tube in the myringotomy incision. An ear tube equalizes pressure in your ears and helps prevent recurrent (returning) infections.When is a myringotomy necessary?A myringotomy may be necessary for children and adults with:Frequent ear infections (acute otitis media).Ear bleeding due to trauma, severe infection or a ruptured eardrum.Balance problems.Hearing loss or muffled hearing.Speech delays (in children).Ear barotrauma (a painful feeling in your ears due to air pressure changes).Most myringotomies are performed on children because young people are more prone to ear infections. However, many adults need myringotomy, too. Barotrauma is the most common reason for myringotomy in adults.AdvertisementWhat is the purpose of a myringotomy?The main purpose of a myringotomy is to allow fluid that\u2019s trapped in your middle ear to drain out. This fluid could be water, blood or pus.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a myringotomy?Your healthcare provider will perform an examination of your ear using an instrument called an otoscope. They may also run hearing tests and blood tests, and they\u2019ll likely perform a tympanogram \u2014 a test that measures how well your ear drum responds to pressure changes.If your healthcare provider determines that a myringotomy is right for you, they\u2019ll give you a list of preoperative instructions. Generally, you shouldn\u2019t eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your myringotomy procedure. You\u2019ll also need to arrange for a trusted friend or family member to drive you to and from your appointment.AdvertisementWhat happens during a myringotomy procedure?In most cases, myringotomy surgery is performed under general anesthesia to keep you comfortable. But it may also be done with a topical anesthetic in the office. During your myringotomy procedure, your surgeon uses a small microscope so they can see your eardrum clearly. Next, they\u2019ll create a tiny hole in your eardrum and drain the fluid from your middle ear. In some cases, your surgeon will also perform a tympanostomy by placing an ear tube (myringotomy tube) into the incision. This ear tube allows drainage from your middle ear to continue.No stitches are necessary because the incision will heal on its own. Once your myringotomy surgery is complete, your surgeon will pack your ear with gauze. From start to finish, a myringotomy takes about 15 to 20 minutes.Is myringotomy painful?Anesthesia prevents pain during myringotomy surgery. However, you may experience some mild pain or discomfort following your procedure. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers to ease discomfort. Your surgeon may also give you numbing ear drops. Be sure to take all medications as directed.What happens after a myringotomy?Your ear might feel clogged after myringotomy surgery. This is a normal side effect, and it could take a few days for your hearing to improve.Your surgeon will give you a detailed list of postoperative instructions. You\u2019ll need to follow these guidelines closely to ensure a successful recovery.
