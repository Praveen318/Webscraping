PolicyMicroneedling vs. microdermabrasion: What\u2019s the difference?Microneedling and microdermabrasion are both procedures to improve the look and texture of your skin. But microdermabrasion doesn\u2019t use needles. Instead, a healthcare provider uses a device with a rough edge, like sandpaper, to exfoliate the uppermost layer of your skin. Microneedling goes deeper into your skin than microdermabrasion, so it might work better for problems beneath the surface, such as acne scars.Who gets microneedling?Microneedling has cosmetic and medical uses. You might consider microneedling if you\u2019re concerned about:Enlarged pores.Fine lines or wrinkles.Loose or crepey (thin and wrinkled) skin.Mild scars, especially those from acne or burns.Skin discoloration or uneven skin tone.Stretch marks.The procedure can also help people who have medical conditions such as:Alopecia areata (hair loss due to an autoimmune disease).Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).In some cases, healthcare providers use microneedling to deliver drugs or vaccines directly into your skin. The microneedles might be part of a patch that people apply themselves instead of going to their healthcare provider for shots.AdvertisementWho shouldn\u2019t have microneedling?Talk to your healthcare provider before getting microneedling if you have:Acne or are taking medication for acne.Blood disorders or are on anticoagulants (drugs that prevent blood clots).Cancer and are receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy.Frequent skin rashes (contact dermatitis) or cold sores.Keloidal tendency (your skin forms hard, raised scars).Moles, freckles, skin tags or other growths that change in size or shape or bleed.Skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before microneedling?Before microneedling, you have a consultation with a healthcare provider. A plastic surgeon, dermatologist or aesthetician might perform microneedling. Make sure that whoever does the procedure has experience in this technique.Your healthcare provider will examine your skin, review your health history and discuss your goals for the procedure. They may also take photos of the area so you can compare your skin before and after microneedling.This is a good time to ask any questions you may have about microneedling, such as:Are there risks or side effects?Does microneedling hurt?How soon will I see results?Is there downtime after the procedure?Will I need more than one treatment?About a month before treatment, your healthcare provider may ask you to apply vitamin A or C cream to your skin. These creams can help start the process of collagen production.AdvertisementWhat happens during microneedling?Your healthcare provider cleans your skin and applies a numbing cream or ointment, such as lidocaine gel. They do this about 30 minutes to 45 minutes before your procedure, so the ointment has time to work.Next, your healthcare provider uses a hand-held roller or an electric tool to make the wounds in your skin. The roller has tiny needles. Your healthcare provider rolls it slowly and gently across your skin. If they use the electric device, needles pulse up and down to puncture your skin. They can change the length of the needles on the electric device. Longer needles go deeper into your skin, which might be necessary if you have deep scars or pockmarks from acne. Needle lengths can range from 0.5 millimeters to 2 millimeters.You might feel warmth or a scratching sensation on your face once the microneedling starts. Some people feel discomfort if the needles are near bony areas, such as your cheekbones. Deep microneedling might cause a little bleeding.A microneedling procedure can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the area that needs treatment.What happens after microneedling?Microneedling is an outpatient procedure, so you can go home once it\u2019s done. Your skin might be red and swollen for up to five days. An ice pack can help reduce irritation and discomfort. Most people can wear makeup the day after the procedure, but you should stay out of the sun until your skin heals.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dermatology CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of microneedling?Microneedling is a safe procedure, but risks may include:Bruising.Scarring.Skin infection.What are the benefits of microneedling?Microneedling can help improve the appearance and texture of your skin.
