It's performed once your cervix has begun to dilate and can't be done if your cervix is still closed. This separation of the amniotic membranes from the uterus speeds up labor in pregnant people. Membrane sweeps help your body release chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins soften your cervix and prepare your body for labor. There is no guarantee a membrane sweep will kickstart your labor or start contractions. It's an optional procedure that your healthcare provider may suggest as you near or pass your due date.It's also called stripping the membranes, membrane stripping or sweeping the membranes.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It's performed once your cervix is partially dilated (or open), but contractions have not begun or have started then stopped. It's done around 39 or 40 weeks in pregnancy to avoid having to induce labor medically. Pregnancies that go beyond 41 or 42 weeks put you and your baby at risk for complications. Membrane sweeps are often suggested as the first option to get labor started naturally before scheduling an induction date.What week in pregnancy do membrane sweeps happen?Membrane sweeps are not performed until 39 weeks or later in pregnancy but can be performed up until 42 weeks.
