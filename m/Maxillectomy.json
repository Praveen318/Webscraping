PolicyWhy might I need a maxillectomy?This condition treats cancers that start in or spread to your:Maxilla.Nose (nasopharyngeal cancer).Roof of your mouth (oral cancer).Sinuses (sinonasal tumors).People who have invasive fungal sinusitis may also need a maxillectomy. You can develop this serious condition after inhaling certain types of fungus. It causes inflammation and loss of tissue in your sinus lining.Is the maxilla the only structure that\u2019s removed?If the cancer has spread to nearby tissue, removing all or part of those structures may be necessary. This may involve your:Eye.Front area of your hard palate (roof of your mouth).Nerve that provides sensation to the skin under your eye.Orbit, bone around your eye (eye socket).Orbital floor, bone below your eye.Teeth attached to the section of maxilla removed.Tear duct.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat are the types of maxillectomy?The type of maxillectomy you have depends on the tumor size and location. Surgical approaches include:Medial maxillectomy removes part of your maxilla nearest to your nose and adjoining teeth. This procedure is typically for tumors inside of your nose and doesn\u2019t require reconstruction. Your surgeon accesses the tumor through an incision on the side of your nose. Another approach involves passing a long, thin tube (endoscope) through your nostril.Infrastructure maxillectomy removes the lower part of your maxilla, teeth and hard palate. An infrastructure maxillectomy leaves a hole in the roof of your mouth. Surgeons may take a flap of tissue from another area of your body to close it. Or you may require a special prosthetic to seal the hole.Suprastructure maxillectomy removes the upper part of your maxilla. It may also involve adjoining teeth, orbital floor, orbit, eye, tear duct and nearby nerve. Reconstruction is necessary to repair the missing structures. A human-made (prosthetic) eye can preserve a natural appearance, but it won\u2019t restore vision.Subtotal (partial) maxillectomy removes part of your maxilla using one of the procedures above.Total maxillectomy removes your entire maxilla on one side of your face, along with your hard palate and orbital floor. It requires major reconstructive surgery and prosthetic devices.What additional procedures might I need?Additional procedures you may need with a maxillectomy include:Feeding tube placement to help you get nutrition.Dacryocystorhinostomy to route tears away from your eyes if the maxillectomy involved your tear ducts.Neck dissection to remove nearby lymph nodes if there\u2019s a concern the cancer has spread.Tracheostomy if there\u2019s a concern that swelling could affect your airway.Reconstructive surgery to restore facial features.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet ENT (Otolaryngology) CareMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of a maxillectomy?The procedure removes cancerous tissue, giving you a better chance for survival.What are the risks of a maxillectomy?Maxillectomy has many risks, including:Bleeding and bruising (hematoma).Blood clots.Droopy lower eyelid.Eustachian tube dysfunction.Infection.Numbness in your cheek from nerve damage.Watery eyes (epiphora).Recovery and OutlookWhat can I expect when recovering from a maxillectomy?Your recovery depends on the type of maxillectomy.
