The mitral valve keeps blood flowing in the correct direction between your lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) and your upper left heart chamber (left atrium). You may need a mitral valve repair if your mitral valve isn\u2019t working properly.If your surgeon performs the minimally invasive mitral valve repair with the surgical robot, your surgeon will insert tiny surgical tools and cameras through one or more small chest incisions. This approach is less invasive than traditional open-heart surgery, which uses a long incision down the front of your chest.What does a minimally invasive mitral valve repair treat?You may need a mitral valve repair if you have:Mitral valve regurgitation: The flaps in your mitral valve don\u2019t close properly between heartbeats, which allows blood to leak backward.Mitral valve stenosis: The flaps in your mitral valve stiffen and may even fuse. This decreases blood flow and narrows your mitral valve.What is the difference between a mitral valve repair and a mitral valve replacement?In a mitral valve repair, your surgeon fixes a problem in your mitral valve but doesn\u2019t remove the mitral valve.

Whether you are a candidate depends on several factors, including:Your heart\u2019s condition.Whether you need other procedures at the time of mitral valve surgery.Lifestyle: Some people, such as those who smoke or have a body mass index (BMI) above 30, may not be good surgical candidates.Medical history: You may not be a surgery candidate if you have severe coronary artery disease or aortic valve disease.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
