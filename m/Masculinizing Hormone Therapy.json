PolicyWho is masculinizing hormone therapy for?This therapy allows some gender-nonconforming people who are designated female at birth (DFAB) to feel more comfortable in their bodies. For many transgender men and nonbinary DFAB people, masculinizing hormone therapy changes the way they look and sound to better match their understanding of their gender or gender identity.Masculinizing hormone therapy is just one option for treating gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is the medical term for the emotional distress that happens when society\u2019s expectations of your gender don\u2019t match your gender identity. Hormone therapy may allow you to feel more at ease living as your authentic self.How does it work?People of all genders produce the hormone testosterone, but your body produces less of it if you\u2019re DFAB. Instead, your body produces more estrogen, the hormone that causes secondary sex characteristics associated with traditional femininity, like rounded breasts and hips.Masculinizing hormone therapy reduces the amount of estrogen your body makes and boosts your testosterone levels high enough to:Suppress secondary sex characteristics associated with being AFAB.Induce secondary sex characteristics associated with being AMAB.AdvertisementWhat changes can I expect from masculinizing hormone therapy?You may notice changes as early as one month after you\u2019ve started taking testosterone, but it may take a little longer to achieve the maximum effects. How quickly your body responds to the therapy depends on individual factors, like your age and genetics. In general, you can expect:Oily skin and acne: Should begin to see changes in one to six months, with full effect in one to two years.No more periods (amenorrhea): Should see full effect in two to six months.More facial and body hair: Should begin to see changes in three to six months, with full effect in three to five years.Hair loss on your scalp: Should begin to see changes after a year. The length of time to reach the full effect varies.Greater muscle mass and strength: Should begin to see changes in six to 12 months, with full effect in two to five years.Redistribution of body fat (like fat deposits in your abdomen instead of your hips): Should see full effect in three to six months, with full effect in two to five years.A deeper voice: Should begin to see changes in three to 12 months, with full effect in one to two years.A larger clitoris (and vaginal atrophy): Should begin to see changes in three to six months, with full effect in one to two years.Increased sex drive: Time to changes varies.Many of these changes persist even if you stop taking hormones. Others require that you continue taking testosterone regularly.
