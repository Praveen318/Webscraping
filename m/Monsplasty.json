Your mons pubis is the mound of tissue in front of your pubic bones, usually covered in pubic hair. A monsplasty is a cosmetic procedure. It lifts, tightens and reshapes the structure of your mons pubis to change its appearance. It may also improve function and comfort.Another name for a monsplasty is a pubic lift.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho is a good candidate for a monsplasty?In general, you\u2019re a good candidate for a monsplasty if you:Have extra tissue or skin that hangs from your mons pubis over your genitals, making it difficult to clean the areas or causing rashes or infections.Have difficulty peeing (urinating) or having sex because of a large mons pubis.Don\u2019t have a medical condition that affects your body\u2019s healing ability.Don\u2019t have heart disease, diabetes or lung disease.Don\u2019t smoke or are able to quit smoking for at least four weeks (two weeks before the procedure and two weeks after the procedure).Have realistic expectations.A tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) and liposuction don\u2019t lift your pubic area. Your mons pubis may even be more noticeable after those procedures. Your healthcare provider may recommend getting a monsplasty at the same time as a tummy tuck or liposuction.Why do people get monsplasty?You may develop excess skin and fatty tissue in your mons pubis as a result of:Age.Pregnancy.Significant weight loss.Your skin contains collagen fibers that allow it to move, stretch and return to its normal shape (elasticity). If you gain weight, fat often builds in your mons pubis, and your skin over the area stretches out. When you carry that weight over long periods, the skin on your mons pubis may lose its elasticity and hang from the area.Excess skin in that area can affect your mental health. It may affect you psychosocially (how society and groups affect your thoughts and emotions) and psychologically (how you think about yourself and your behavior), which may cause stress, anxiety and depression.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a monsplasty?Before your monsplasty, you\u2019ll meet with your healthcare provider. They\u2019ll evaluate your general health, including any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors, and discuss your expectations with the procedure. Tell them about any previous surgeries you\u2019ve had, as well as any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that you\u2019re taking, including herbal supplements. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your risk of bleeding.Your healthcare provider will then examine your mons pubis while you\u2019re standing. They can see how your skin and fatty tissue look on your body and how gravity affects the area from a standing position. They\u2019ll use a marker to mark the area. The marks help your healthcare provider plan the procedure, including guiding cuts (incisions), creating an even shape (symmetry) and concealing or minimizing scars.Your healthcare provider may take photographs of your body from the front and the side (profile) for your medical record.What happens during a monsplasty?During most monsplasties, you\u2019re sedated (put under) with general anesthesia so you aren\u2019t awake and won\u2019t feel any pain. In some cases, your healthcare provider uses local anesthesia and an oral sedative. Local anesthesia numbs only your mons pubis and the surrounding areas. An oral sedative helps you relax to the point where you\u2019re asleep but can be easily aroused or awakened.Once you\u2019re asleep or sedated, your surgeon will use a sharp, thin knife (scalpel) to make a horizontal incision across your mons pubis. Your surgeon will then use a scalpel or surgical scissors to cut off excess fatty tissue and skin. They\u2019ll then use internal sutures to tighten and shape your muscles and other tissues.Finally, your surgeon may place small silicone tubes in your mons pubis to drain any blood or fluid. They\u2019ll stitch the tubes into place and stitch the incision closed.AdvertisementWhat happens after a monsplasty?After a monsplasty is complete, your healthcare provider will cover your incisions with bandages. They may also wrap the area with an elastic bandage or compression garment to help minimize swelling and support your mons pubis as it heals.Your anesthesiologist will stop putting anesthesia into your body to keep you asleep.You\u2019ll move to a recovery room, where healthcare providers will wait for you to wake up and monitor your overall health.Most monsplasties are outpatient procedures, so you can go home the same day you have the surgery. You may have to stay at the healthcare facility overnight if you have a monsplasty at the same time as a tummy tuck or liposuction.Once your healthcare providers determine you no longer need monitoring, they\u2019ll let you go home (discharge you). You must have a family member or friend drive you home and take care of you for at least the first 24 hours after your monsplasty.Care at Cleveland ClinicPlastic Surgery CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of a monsplasty?There are many advantages to a monsplasty, including:Self-esteem boost.
