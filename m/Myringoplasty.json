Your eardrum (tympanic membrane) is a thin, dime-sized piece of tissue located between your middle ear and outer ear. It helps you hear by vibrating in response to sound waves.Your eardrum can tear or rupture as a result of ear infections, head trauma, sticking objects in your ear, sudden loud noises and more. Myringoplasty repairs the hole in your eardrum and reduces your risk for further health issues such as vertigo, mastoiditis (an infection of the bone behind your ear) and, in severe cases, permanent hearing loss.Myringoplasty is one of the most common procedures performed by otolaryngologists (specialists who treat conditions of the ear, nose and throat). Children are more likely to need myringoplasty, but sometimes, adults need the procedure, too. Most people only need myringoplasty in one ear (unilateral myringoplasty). But in some cases, people need it in both (bilateral myringoplasty).Who needs myringoplasty?In most cases, a ruptured eardrum heals on its own in just a few weeks. Your healthcare provider may recommend myringoplasty when you or your child:Has a ruptured eardrum that hasn\u2019t healed within three months.Has chronic or recurring (returning) ear infections.Has hearing loss due to a ruptured eardrum.Sustains trauma that results in a perforated (torn) eardrum.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
