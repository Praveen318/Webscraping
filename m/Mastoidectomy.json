Your mastoid is the part of your skull that sits just behind your ear. Mastoidectomy is often used to treat cholesteatoma, or ear infections that have spread into your skull. It\u2019s also used when placing cochlear implants.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is a mastoidectomy?A mastoidectomy is a surgery that removes diseased mastoid air cells.

PolicyWhy is mastoidectomy performed?A mastoidectomy is necessary when an ear infection (otitis media) spreads to your skull. The procedure is also used to treat cholesteatoma \u2014 a noncancerous growth that forms behind your eardrum, often as a complication of chronic ear infections. In many cases, mastoidectomy is performed during cochlear implant surgery.If you have a ruptured eardrum, your surgeon will perform a mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty. A tympanoplasty is a surgery to repair your eardrum. Tympanoplasty also refers to surgery behind your eardrum even if your eardrum doesn\u2019t need repair.Procedure DetailsHow serious is a mastoidectomy?The extensiveness of surgery depends on your unique situation. A simple mastoidectomy will treat disease in your mastoid while leaving your ear canal and middle ear structures completely intact.A canal-wall-up mastoidectomy or tympanomastoidectomy removes more bone than a simple mastoidectomy. This is done so your surgeon can gain access to the middle-ear space behind your eardrum, including your ossicles \u2014 the three tiny bones inside of your ear that transmit sound waves. This procedure leaves your ear canal completely intact.A canal-wall-down mastoidectomy or tympanomastoidectomy is performed when the disease has damaged your ear canal beyond repair or when the removal of your ear canal is required for the complete removal of disease. This procedure combines your ear canal and mastoid bone into a large open space called a mastoid cavity, or mastoid bowl. The opening of your ear canal is typically enlarged to facilitate the cleaning of your mastoid cavity in the future. This surgery is sometimes called a radical or modified mastoidectomy, and it\u2019s reserved for extensive disease or recurrent (repeating) disease that\u2019s failed a more limited surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens before a mastoidectomy?Your healthcare provider will give you a list of preoperative instructions, which you should follow closely. In some cases, you may need to temporarily stop taking certain medications. Because mastoidectomy is performed under general anesthesia, you\u2019ll also need to arrange for a trusted friend or family member to drive you to and from your appointment.What happens during a mastoidectomy?You\u2019ll be placed under general anesthesia to ensure your comfort during the procedure. Next, your surgeon will:Create an incision behind your ear to access your mastoid bone. (Your surgeon will place this incision carefully to minimize the appearance of your mastoidectomy scar.)Use specialized instruments to open your mastoid bone.Remove the infected air cells in your mastoid.Close the surgical site with stitches.Dress the surgical wound with gauze.A mastoidectomy surgery usually takes about two to three hours to complete.How painful is a mastoidectomy?You shouldn\u2019t feel any pain during your mastoidectomy. However, like any surgery, a mastoidectomy can result in some mild discomfort after the procedure. The incision behind your ear will likely be sore, and your ear may feel full or stuffy. You can manage these side effects with over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Your surgeon will also give you post-operative instructions that\u2019ll help keep you comfortable during the healing phase.AdvertisementWhat happens after a mastoidectomy?After your mastoidectomy, you\u2019ll wake up in recovery. Your medical team will monitor your progress \u2014 and when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll be able to go home. Your surgeon will give you specific postoperative guidelines. It\u2019s important to follow these closely.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet ENT (Otolaryngology) CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of a mastoidectomy?A mastoidectomy can treat chronic ear infections and minimize their recurrence (return).

However, most people can return to work, school and other routine activities in approximately one to two weeks.What\u2019s the outlook for people who undergo mastoidectomy surgery?Mastoidectomy is largely successful, but the outlook varies based on the reason for the surgery and the type of mastoidectomy performed. The primary goal of mastoidectomy isn\u2019t to restore hearing, but rather, to eliminate infection that can lead to further problems. It\u2019s important to note that some hearing loss is common with radical or canal-wall-down mastoidectomy.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?If you\u2019ve recently undergone a mastoidectomy, you should call your healthcare provider if you have:A fever of 100.5 Fahrenheit (38.05 Celsius) or higher.Heavy ear bleeding or discharge.Facial weakness.Dizziness or vertigo.Hearing loss.A note from Cleveland ClinicIf you have recurring, or repeating, ear infections or complications that arise as a result of them, a mastoidectomy may be the best line of treatment.
