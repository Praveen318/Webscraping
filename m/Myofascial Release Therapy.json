The stringy tissue is densely woven throughout your muscles, bones, nerves, arteries, veins and organs. Your fascia is one continuous structure throughout your body. Each part of your body is connected to it in some way. That\u2019s why if there\u2019s a snag in the tissue in one part of your body, it can cause pain in another part of your body.Normally, fascia is flexible and stretchy. But it\u2019s strong. It provides structural support to your body and protects your muscles. Fascia is usually able to move without any restrictions. When your body experiences any kind of trauma, your fascia loses its flexibility. It becomes tightened and more rigid. The tightness can lead to pain and loss of motion, which can affect your quality of life.Is myofascial release the same as trigger point therapy?Yes.
