A plastic surgeon, dermatologist or cosmetologist/aesthetician can perform microdermabrasion. They\u2019ll go over your health history and your goals for the procedure. They may also take before photos of the area of skin that will have treatment.This is a good time to ask any questions you may have about the procedure, like:Are there any risks?How many treatments will I need?What kind of results can I expect?Will my skin be red or very sensitive after treatment?What do microdermabrasion facials do?You don\u2019t need topical or local anesthetic to numb your skin before microdermabrasion. The procedure usually isn\u2019t painful, but you might feel a scratching, stinging, sucking or vibrating sensation on your skin.Your healthcare provider uses one of two techniques to remove dead or damaged cells in microdermabrasion:Crystal microdermabrasion: Using this method, your dermatologist shoots tiny crystals through a tube. The crystals loosen and knock off dead skin cells. Then, your provider vacuums up the debris (the crystals and dead skill cells) using the same tube. It\u2019s like sandblasting only much, much gentler.Diamond microdermabrasion: In this method, your dermatologist uses a diamond-tipped wand to remove (and vacuum up debris from) the top layer of your skin. This works a little more like an electric sander, but it\u2019s much, much gentler.Treatment usually lasts about 30 to 40 minutes.What happens after microdermabrasion?You can go home right after your procedure. Your skin might be a little red, swollen or sensitive for up to 24 hours.

So, you\u2019ll need a bit more recovery time after dermabrasion.A note from Cleveland ClinicThese days, you might feel like everyone is getting something done to their skin to look younger. But it\u2019s important to remember that aging is a natural process. You are beautiful just as you are.That said, sometimes, having smooth, healthy-looking skin can give us a boost of confidence as we age.
