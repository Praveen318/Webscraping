PolicyWhat does MonaLisa Touch treat?The MonaLisa Touch treats symptoms of GSM that most commonly occur in menopause. Menopause is when a person assigned female at birth (AFAB) stops getting their period and loses the ability to get pregnant. During menopause, your estrogen levels decrease. These hormonal changes cause your vaginal tissue to become dry and thin. This can lead to several symptoms such as:Painful sexual intercourse.Vaginal discomfort and bleeding.Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).Urinary incontinence (leaking pee when you sneeze, laugh or cough).Vaginal irritation, itchiness or burning.The MonaLisa Touch helps the tissues in your vagina regenerate, helping it to become moist again.It\u2019s important to note that the MonaLisa Touch doesn\u2019t tighten your vagina. There are other methods your provider may suggest if your goal is to fix looseness or sagging. The MonaLisa Touch helps restore your vagina\u2019s lubrication, not necessarily its appearance.Who can have MonaLisa Touch treatment?The ideal candidates for MonaLisa Touch treatment are people who:Are experiencing symptoms of low estrogen during the transition to menopause or after menopause.Tried other methods (such as estrogen therapy) and were unsuccessful.Have symptoms as a result of chemotherapy, breast cancer or hysterectomy.Can\u2019t take estrogen due to other health conditions or treatments.Have been diagnosed with vulvar disorders like lichen sclerosus.If you have any of the following health conditions, MonaLisa treatment may not be right for you:You\u2019re pregnant or gave birth within the last three months.You have bladder prolapse.You have a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or other vaginal infection.You\u2019re receiving anticoagulants or have immune thrombocytopenia.Talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms and health history.

This essentially causes the tissue lining to regenerate and repair itself.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsDo I need to prepare for MonaLisa Touch treatment?No. There\u2019s nothing you need to do to prepare for treatment.
