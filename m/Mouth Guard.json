We can categorize them according to purpose:Mouth guards for sports. These protect your teeth from sports-related injuries. If you play sports like boxing, wrestling, soccer, basketball, hockey or football, mouth guards can greatly reduce your risk for chipped and avulsed (knocked out) teeth.Mouth guards for grinding teeth. These appliances help protect your teeth from the effects of grinding and clenching. They may also reduce the effects of TMJ disorders. You can wear this type of mouth guard any time, night or day. But because most people grind or clench their teeth during sleep, it\u2019s common to wear them at night. (Some people refer to these appliances as night guards.)Snoring and sleep apnea mouth guards. People with chronic snoring or obstructive sleep apnea may benefit from a custom mouth guard. This type of appliance shifts and repositions your jaw to open your airway during sleep.In addition, mouth guards may be store-bought or custom-made:Store-bought: There are two main types of store-bought mouth guards. Stock (which you wear as-is, right out of the box) and boil-and-bite (which you can slightly customize at home). Store-bought guards are cheaper, but they\u2019re not as effective as custom-made mouth guards for protection against teeth grinding or sports-related injuries. They\u2019re also not appropriate for treating sleep apnea.Custom-made: A dentist creates this type of mouth guard to fit your exact dental anatomy. Because they\u2019re designed to fit your teeth, they tend to be more comfortable than store-bought mouth guards. Custom-made mouth guards provide effective protection against bruxism and sports-related trauma. They\u2019re also a common first line of defense in sleep apnea treatment. You can wear them with or without a CPAP machine. (Custom-made mouth guards are usually more costly, but they last longer compared to store-bought guards.)AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
