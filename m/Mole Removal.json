It\u2019s generally a quick, outpatient procedure that allows your healthcare provider to test the mole for skin cancer. Some people also have moles removed for cosmetic reasons.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

People with darker hair or skin tend to have darker moles than people with fairer hair or skin. Moles can be flat or raised from the surface of your skin. Your healthcare provider might refer to your mole as a nevus (\u201cnee-vis\u201d) or a group of moles as nevi (\u201cneev-eye\u201d).It\u2019s normal to have about 10\u201340 moles by the time you\u2019re an adult. Some moles grow slowly and may lighten or disappear over time. Most moles are harmless, but you should see your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about the appearance of a mole, or if it changes color or shape, becomes itchy or bleeds.Sometimes, moles are skin cancer or precancerous. If your mole is itchy, bleeds, isn\u2019t round or oval, or you notice changes in its appearance, contact your healthcare provider.Why is mole removal done?Mole removal treats atypical moles anywhere on your face, neck, arms legs or torso. Your healthcare provider may recommend removal of an atypical mole so they can run a test (biopsy) to see if the growth is cancerous (malignant) or precancerous. And if your dermatologist is able to remove the mole and achieves good margins (the area around the mole), mole removal may serve as a curative treatment for skin cancer that hasn\u2019t spread.Your healthcare provider may also remove a mole if you\u2019re unhappy with its location or appearance.AdvertisementWho needs to have this treatment?Most moles don\u2019t require treatment. But you might want to have a mole removed if you\u2019re unhappy with how it looks or feels. Talk with your healthcare provider if you\u2019re concerned about a mole. Generally, moles are removed if your provider suspects they might be cancerous or for cosmetic reasons.Atypical mole removalTypical moles are round, flat or slightly raised, even in color and stay pretty much the same shape and size over time. But if your mole looks atypical (dysplastic), your healthcare provider might suggest removing it so they can run tests to determine if it\u2019s cancer (malignant) or not cancer (benign).Cosmetic mole removalWhether you were born with a mole or it developed over time, you might not like how it looks or feels. If you have a mole that bothers you, discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. Don\u2019t attempt at-home mole removal. Getting a mole removed by a medical professional is safer and you\u2019ll be happier with how you look after you heal.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before this procedure?Before a mole removal procedure, your healthcare provider inspects your skin. They may take pictures of your moles to compare against at a later date. They may also use a tool called a dermoscope to get a closer look at the mole and determine how to best remove it.Your healthcare provider will mark the areas on your skin to be removed. Then, they\u2019ll clean the area. You\u2019ll receive numbing medicine (anesthetic). This might be applied on your skin (topically) or you may get an injection at the surgical site.

As with all surgical procedures, there are risks and benefits to both types of mole removal procedures. Talk with your dermatologist about which method is right for you.Surgical excisionExcision is a very common technique for mole removal. After cleaning and numbing the area, your surgeon uses a scalpel to separate your mole from the rest of your skin. Depending on the type of mole, they\u2019ll take a margin of healthy skin to ensure that all of the atypical cells are removed. Then, using forceps to grasp the segment, they lift the mole away. Bleeding is normal, and your surgeon may apply pressure to the area or burn (cauterize) it to stop the bleeding before stitching the area back together.Shave excisionAnother common technique for mole removal is shave excision. Your healthcare provider may be able to remove a mole by shaving rather than cutting. Shave excision can provide a sample of tissue for analysis, and people are generally pleased with the results after healing. But shave excision isn\u2019t useful for looking at deep tumor margins, and can\u2019t be used to distinguish between different types of skin cancer.For shave excision mole removal, your healthcare provider uses a single or double-bladed razor to carefully shave the growth off to the level of the skin around it. They may lightly burn (cauterize) the area around the removed mole to improve the appearance of any scar after healing.Moles removed by shave incision are somewhat more likely to come back than moles removed by surgical excision.What about lasers or other possible methods of mole removal?Although some healthcare providers have used lasers, electric current (cautery) or liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) to remove moles in the past, these techniques aren\u2019t usually recommended. Using these methods means there\u2019s no sample of your mole to study in order to identify what sort of mole it is. Additionally, moles are more likely to come back (recur) following these treatments. Sometimes, benign moles that come back after nonsurgical removal can have features of skin cancer.What happens after this procedure?After removing your mole, your healthcare provider will apply petroleum jelly (Vaseline\u00ae) to the area and cover it with a bandage. You should keep the area moist (with the jelly) for a few days and clean it daily.Care at Cleveland ClinicMole TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of surgical mole removal?The main benefit of having a mole removal procedure is that your healthcare provider can run tests to determine if the mole is skin cancer.
