It can treat refractive errors, so you\u2019ll no longer need contact lenses or glasses. Your surgeon will need to examine you and measure your eyes to see if you\u2019re eligible for ICL surgery.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsOverviewAn implantable collamer lens (ICL) surgery treats poor eyesight from refractive errors by putting an ICL in between your natural lens and your iris.What is Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) surgery?ICL surgery is a procedure that treats poor eyesight from refractive errors by implanting a Collamer\u00ae lens into your eye. This surgery may be possible for people who don\u2019t meet the criteria for LASIK surgery.A Collamer lens combines plastic and collagen to create a more natural and flexible lens. These lenses are lighter than other types of lenses and hydrophilic (they can mix with water and become wet). A Collamer lens is better than some other types of lenses at letting gas and nutrients pass through.Your surgeon will place the implanted lens behind your iris and in front of your natural lens.Earlier versions of the implantable lens called for a surgeon to perform a laser iridotomy before the ICL surgery. Your surgeon would make one or two tiny holes in your iris. This would help prevent pressure from building up when they implanted the lens into your eye. The tiny holes allow for proper drainage of aqueous fluid.Now, there\u2019s the EVO Implantable Collamer Lens, which comes with a tiny hole in the middle of the lens. This hole makes laser iridotomy unnecessary. Fluids can flow naturally through the hole.What does an Implantable Collamer Lens surgery treat?You might have an ICL surgery if you have these refractive errors:Nearsightedness (myopia).Astigmatism.How common is this procedure?Surgeons have performed an estimated 500,000 ICL procedures throughout the world, using about 1 million lenses.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
