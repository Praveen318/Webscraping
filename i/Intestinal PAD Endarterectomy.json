Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood throughout your body.Your healthcare provider uses the procedure to remove plaque, a fatty and calcified substance that can build up in arteries. Providers use endarterectomies to improve blood flow and reduce your risk of blood clots or stroke.What are the types of endarterectomies?The type of endarterectomy you have depends on where you have a blocked artery:Carotid endarterectomy removes plaque from the arteries running through your neck to your brain.Femoral endarterectomy removes plaque from arteries in your groin going to your legs.Aortic and iliac endarterectomy removes plaque from the main arteries in your abdomen and pelvis.Who needs an endarterectomy?You may need an endarterectomy if you have atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is plaque buildup in an artery, eventually leading to stiff, narrowed arteries.Usually, providers recommend an endarterectomy for moderate to severe atherosclerosis, especially if it causes symptoms. However, everyone\u2019s situation is unique.What conditions does an endarterectomy treat?An endarterectomy is a treatment option for some people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). In PAD, plaque builds up in the arteries in your legs or arms. This blocks blood flow and may lead to pain, wounds and eventual death (gangrene) of your tissues.You may also need an endarterectomy to treat carotid artery disease. In carotid artery disease, plaque builds up in your carotid arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood to your brain. Carotid artery narrowing can lead to a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) if you don\u2019t get treatment.Who isn\u2019t a candidate for an endarterectomy?Some people have risk factors that mean endarterectomy isn\u2019t a suitable treatment option. You may not be a candidate for an endarterectomy if you have conditions that would make the surgery more dangerous, such as:Decompensated congestive heart failure.Recent heart attack (myocardial infarction).Severe emphysema or COPD.Radiation damage to the area.Infection in the area.Extensive calcification or thrombus.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat tests will I have before an endarterectomy?Before an endarterectomy, you\u2019ll likely have tests to evaluate the extent of the artery blockage, including:Angiography, using a contrast dye and X-rays to take pictures of your blood vessels.Doppler ultrasound, using sound waves to evaluate blood flow through your blood vessels.Magnetic resonance angiography, using magnets and radio waves to take pictures of your blood vessels.CT angiogram, using advanced X-rays to make a three-dimensional picture of your body and blood vessels.You may also have tests to assess your overall heart health, such as an echocardiogram or stress test. Cardiovascular tests help your provider evaluate your heart attack risk and determine if you\u2019re a good candidate for surgery.What happens before an endarterectomy?Your provider gives you instructions to prepare for an endarterectomy. You may need to stop taking certain medications, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), temporarily. In other cases, your provider may tell you to start taking medicines that inhibit platelets and clots, such as aspirin, for a period before the procedure.You\u2019ll need to fast before an endarterectomy. Your anesthesia team will tell you how long to fast before the operation.AdvertisementWhat happens during an endarterectomy?You receive anesthesia so you don\u2019t feel any pain during an endarterectomy. Your provider sometimes keeps you awake during a carotid endarterectomy to better monitor brain function.During the procedure, your healthcare provider:Makes an incision directly over the blocked artery.Places a tube (shunt) to keep blood flowing to your brain during the procedure.Removes plaque from the artery.Closes the artery with sutures, sometimes using a patch to widen the area to prevent re-narrowing. The patch can come from a synthetic graft or a piece of a healthy vein from another part of your body, if needed.Closes the incision.What happens after an endarterectomy?You may have a drainage tube extending from the incision site immediately after surgery to keep the area from bruising. Your provider will remove this before releasing you to go home. The hospital stay will depend on the type of surgery and location. For example, carotid endarterectomy patients are usually in the hospital for one day. Femoral endarterectomies, typically for two to four days and aortic endarterectomies, usually a week.Care at Cleveland ClinicPeripheral Artery Disease TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of an endarterectomy?Endarterectomy removes the blockages and restores your artery back to its normal healthy size.
