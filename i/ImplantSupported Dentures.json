It\u2019s similar to a traditional denture. But instead of resting on top of your gums, an implant-supported denture attaches directly to your jawbone using dental implants. Dental implants are tiny threaded posts that replace missing teeth roots. Implant-supported dentures offer improved stability for chewing, eating and speaking.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs implant-supported dentures?Your healthcare provider may recommend implant-supported dentures if you\u2019re missing most or all of your teeth. People who are missing several teeth in sporadic areas can benefit from implant-supported partial dentures. Your dentist can tell you which option is best for your situation.To qualify for implant-supported dentures, you must have enough bone in your jaw to accommodate the dental implants. In many cases, dental bone grafts can help add volume and density to areas where you\u2019ve lost bone.Do implant-supported dentures come out?When it comes to implant-supported dentures, there are fixed and removable options. The treatment that\u2019s right for you depends on several factors, including the health of your jawbone, your medical history and your personal preferences.Removable implant-supported denturesThis type of denture \u201csnaps on\u201d to dental implants in your jawbone. It stays securely in place until you\u2019re ready to remove it.With this option, you can take your dentures out every day for easy cleaning.Fixed implant-supported denturesA fixed denture \u2014 sometimes called a hybrid denture \u2014 attaches permanently to dental implants in your jawbone. You can\u2019t remove it at home, but your dentist can remove it for maintenance when necessary.With this option, you can\u2019t take your dentures out to clean them. You\u2019ll brush them just like natural teeth, and you can clean underneath them using floss threaders, interproximal brushes and other special cleaning tools.AdvertisementAre implant-supported dentures effective?Implant-supported dentures are a lifelike and effective solution to tooth loss. Unlike their traditional counterparts, implant-supported dentures won\u2019t shift, slip or wobble when you chew, eat or speak. In fact, many traditional denture wearers eventually upgrade to implant-supported dentures because they\u2019re more comfortable and secure.What is the difference between All-on-4\u00ae and implant-supported dentures?The term \u201cAll-on-4\u00ae\u201d refers to a specific type of fixed implant denture. This method replaces an entire arch of missing teeth using just four dental implants.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow are implant-supported dentures placed?The implant-supported dentures process usually requires multiple steps. But exact treatment depends on your specific situation. Your dentist can let you know what to anticipate.Pre-prosthetic surgeryBefore your dentist can place implants, they\u2019ll need to extract any decayed or damaged teeth. They\u2019ll also perform bone grafting in any areas where you\u2019ve lost jawbone density. Depending on your situation, you may need to heal for a few months before implant placement.Your dentist will give you a healing denture to wear during this time.Dental implant placementDuring this procedure, a surgeon (usually a periodontist or oral surgeon) will place the dental implants into your jawbone. Generally, it takes about three to six months for the implants to integrate (fuse) with your jawbone.You\u2019ll wear your healing denture while you wait for your implants to integrate.Dental impressionsOnce your dental implants have healed, your dentist will take impressions of your upper and lower dental arches. They\u2019ll send the impressions to a dental lab so a technician can begin crafting your new dentures.Denture placementFinally, your dentist will attach your new custom denture to your implants. They can also demonstrate proper oral hygiene practices, as well as how to clean and care for your denture.How long do implant-supported dentures last?With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime.
