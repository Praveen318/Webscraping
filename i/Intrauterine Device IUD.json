Once it\u2019s inserted, an IUD can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years or more, depending on the specific type. Your provider can remove your IUD at any time if you decide to become pregnant.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewBoth copper and hormonal IUDs form a T shape inside your uterus that holds the IUD in place.What is an intrauterine device (IUD)?An intrauterine device (IUD) is a type of birth control a healthcare provider inserts into your uterus. IUDs are the most commonly used type of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Once an IUD is inserted, you don\u2019t have to worry about birth control until it\u2019s time to replace it (three to 10 years, depending on the brand). LARCs, which include IUDs and contraceptive implants, are the most effective form of birth control that doesn\u2019t require surgery.If you do decide to become pregnant, your provider can remove your IUD.Unlike other forms of contraception, like condoms, IUDs don\u2019t prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). You can use an IUD with condoms to prevent pregnancy while also reducing your risk of contracting an STI.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat are the different types of IUDs?There are two kinds of IUDs, copper IUDs and hormonal (levonorgestrel) IUDs. Both have plastic frames that open into the shape of a T once inside your uterus. They have strings attached at the bottom that extend into your vagina so that your provider can remove your IUD as needed.The FDA has approved five brands of IUDs: Paragard\u00ae (copper) and Mirena\u00ae, Liletta\u00ae, Kyleena\u00ae and Skyla\u00ae (hormonal).Copper IUDs: Paragard\u2019s IUD has a thin copper wire that coils around the stem part of the \u201cT.\u201d The stem ends in a smooth ball that prevents your cervix from getting punctured when your provider inserts your IUD.Hormonal (levonorgestrel) IUDs: The top part of the \u201cT\u201d contains the progestin hormone levonorgestrel, which flows through the stem. Progestins are a synthetic version of progesterone, a hormone that occurs naturally in your body. Mirena and Liletta are slightly bigger around than Kyleena and Skyla.Both types contain elements that cause them to show up during imaging procedures. Your provider can check your IUD during wellness visits to ensure it\u2019s positioned correctly.How commonly are IUDs used?IUDs are the second most popular form of reversible birth control after birth control pills. Globally, around 23% of women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) who use contraception choose IUDs. In the United States, IUD use increased from 2% to 14% between 2002 and 2014.Who shouldn\u2019t use an IUD?You shouldn\u2019t use an IUD if:You\u2019re pregnant.You have an active sexually transmitted infection (STI).You\u2019re considered high-risk for contracting an STI.You have cervical cancer or uterine cancer.You have unexplained vaginal bleeding.You shouldn\u2019t use copper IUDs if you have a copper allergy or Wilson disease, a genetic condition that causes copper to build up in your body.You shouldn\u2019t use hormonal IUDs if you have severe liver disease or breast cancer. You shouldn\u2019t use them if you\u2019re considered high-risk for breast cancer.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow do IUDs work?All IUDs trigger an immune response. Your body recognizes an IUD as an invader and springs into action to defend itself. This process results in inflammation. Inflammation in your uterus creates an environment that\u2019s toxic to sperm. As a result, sperm can\u2019t reach your fallopian tubes to fertilize an egg.The specific properties of copper and hormonal IUDs also prevent sperm from leaving your uterus.Copper IUDs: Heighten the inflammatory response, causing your uterine lining (endometrium) to become inflamed. Even if sperm were to fertilize an egg, your uterine lining would make it difficult for a fertilized egg (embryo) to implant there and develop.Hormonal IUDs: Release small amounts of the progestin hormone levonorgestrel over time. Levonorgestrel thickens your cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to swim to your fallopian tubes. It also thins your uterus lining and partially suppresses your ability to release an egg during your menstrual cycle.Not all hormonal IUDs contain the same amount of levonorgestrel or have the same release rate. For example, Mirena and Liletta release more progestin than Kyleena and Skyla. Talk with your provider about which brands work best for you.How long do IUDs last?The FDA has approved the use of IUDs based on the following timeline:Paragard: Prevents pregnancy for 10 years.Mirena: Prevents pregnancy for eight years.Liletta: Prevents pregnancy for six years.Kyleena: Prevents pregnancy for five years.Skyla: Prevents pregnancy for three years.Depending on factors like your age and your health, your healthcare provider may recommend that you can safely wear a device for longer and still receive the same amount of protection. Follow your provider\u2019s guidance.AdvertisementHow is an intrauterine device inserted?Only a healthcare provider can insert, adjust or remove an IUD.What happens before an IUD is inserted?Your provider will ensure you\u2019re a good candidate for an IUD based on your health and lifestyle. You may need to take a pregnancy test or get tested for STIs beforehand.Talk with your provider about pain management prior to your procedure. Many people tolerate having an IUD inserted with no problems. Others avoid getting an IUD because they\u2019re concerned about what the experience will feel like. Your provider may recommend that you take pain medications beforehand to lessen any pain or discomfort you may feel. They may also numb the area before the procedure.Communicating openly with your provider can lessen anxiety you may feel about getting an IUD.What happens during the insertion?Inserting an IUD takes fifteen minutes or less. Your provider can perform the procedure during an office visit.You\u2019ll be positioned on a table as if you were having a Pap smear, with your knees bent, legs opened and supported in stirrups.You may be given a numbing injection near your cervix to lessen any pain or discomfort.Your provider will use a speculum to widen your vagina. You may feel mild to intense cramping when your provider inserts the IUD.What happens after the IUD is inserted?You may not notice any side effects, or you may experience mild to intense pain. It\u2019s a good idea to allow yourself some recovery time just in case. Take the rest of the day off work if you can.You may:Feel light-headed or dizzy.Experience cramps or backaches.Experience light bleeding or spotting.Using over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs and heating pads can reduce the pain. Panty liners and pads can help manage any bleeding.How soon will my IUD start working?Paragard starts working immediately. Hormonal IUDs begin preventing pregnancy depending on where you are in your cycle. If you\u2019re on your period, they start working right away. If you\u2019re not on your period, it may take a week for them to offer you protection.
