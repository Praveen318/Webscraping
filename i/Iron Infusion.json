Intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is another name for this. A healthcare provider performs this procedure in a medical office or clinic.If you don\u2019t have enough iron, your body can\u2019t make hemoglobin. This protein helps blood carry oxygen throughout your body. With this issue, you may develop anemia. This is known as iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type of anemia.Factors that can lower your body\u2019s supply of iron include:Blood loss from ulcers, some cancers and other conditions or during monthly periods.A diet that doesn\u2019t have enough iron in it.Medications that interfere with your body\u2019s ability to absorb iron.An increase in your body\u2019s need for iron (for instance, during pregnancy).How common is an iron infusion?Getting iron through an infusion isn\u2019t as common as getting oral (by mouth) iron. Healthcare providers prescribe oral iron supplements first. That works for many people, but some people need to receive iron through an IV if their iron levels are very low.Why is an iron infusion done?People usually receive IV iron infusions because they can\u2019t take oral (by mouth) iron. These include people who:Have bleeding in their gastrointestinal tract (gut) and need to replace iron quickly. (Your body absorbs IV iron more rapidly than iron you swallow.)Have inflammatory bowel disease (diseases of the intestines that cause pain, diarrhea and weight loss), and can\u2019t take oral iron because it upsets their gastrointestinal tract.Are on dialysis and often lose blood during dialysis. In addition, these people are usually taking an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) and may need extra iron.Have iron-deficiency anemia and are having high blood loss surgery (> 500 milliliters) within the next two months and need to replace iron quickly.Have celiac disease (gluten intolerance).Have cancer and anemia and are taking an ESA.Have tried oral iron, but it didn\u2019t work well for them.Have a vascular condition that makes them lose a lot of blood.Need to increase their iron level quickly because of pregnancy or severe anemia.What iron level requires an iron infusion?It depends on the reason you\u2019re taking it. Different conditions require different iron levels. A healthcare provider may give you an IV iron infusion sooner for one condition than another.How many iron infusions do you need?You may only need one dose of some iron infusions. With others, you\u2019ll need one or two doses over the course of several weeks until your iron level is where it should be. It can take two months to fix your iron level and correct anemia.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
