PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before tooth scaling and root planing?Periodontal disease usually doesn\u2019t cause pain. Your dentist may diagnose you with periodontitis during a dental check-up. You may also get dental X-rays to look for problems like cavities, an abscessed tooth (tooth infection) and bone loss. If you have periodontitis, your provider will discuss treatment options with you. Tooth scaling and root planing will take place during a future appointment.What should you expect from a tooth scaling and root planing treatment?This deep dental cleaning goes below your gum line to completely remove tartar from each of your teeth, including their roots. To minimize any discomfort or pain, your provider numbs your mouth with a local anesthetic. You\u2019re awake for the procedures.AdvertisementWhat happens during tooth scaling?Your provider uses a vibrating tool called an ultrasonic scaler to perform the scaling process. These steps may take place during tooth scaling:A vibrating metal tip on the scaler chips tartar off of your teeth above your gum line.A water spray on the scaler washes away the tartar and flushes plaque from the gum pockets.Your provider uses a manual (not powered) dental scaler and scraping device (called a curette) to remove small remaining pieces of tartar.What happens during root planing?Root planing is like tooth scaling except it takes place on the roots of your teeth that sit below your gum line.During root planing, your provider:Uses a tool to gently push aside your gum tissue and expose the surface of the roots.Uses the same tooth scaling tools to chip tartar from the roots, making them smooth.Sometimes, may inject an antibiotic medication directly into any gum pockets.AdvertisementWhat happens after tooth scaling and root planing?Bacteria and plaque are less likely to stick to the smooth surfaces of your treated teeth. Inflammation decreases as your gums heal. Your healthy gums can reattach more firmly to the smoothed tooth roots.During follow-up appointments, your provider will measure the pockets surrounding your gum tissue. If the pockets haven\u2019t decreased, you may need periodontal surgery. Surgical treatments for periodontitis include:Bone graftingto replace lost bone with bone from a donor or lab-made material.Flap surgery (pocket reduction surgery) to make a gum pocket smaller by lowering your gum line.Soft tissue grafting to replace lost gum tissue with tissue from the roof of your mouth (palate) or a donor.How many dental appointments will I need for tooth scaling and root planing?The total number of dental appointments you need for scaling and planing depends on the severity of your condition and your provider\u2019s preference. Some providers treat one side of the mouth (both upper and lower teeth) in one visit. You\u2019ll need a second visit to treat the other side of your mouth.Some providers treat each mouth quadrant separately instead. For instance, they scale and plane only the lower right side of your mouth. At your next appointment, they may treat the upper right side of your mouth. With this treatment approach, you\u2019ll need four appointments.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dental CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of tooth scaling and root planing?Studies show that tooth scaling and root planing are effective treatments for periodontitis.

But some people are afraid to go to the dentist. If this sounds like you, you\u2019re not alone. Dentophobia (also called odontophobia), or fear of dentists, affects as many as 1 in 3 people. For 10% of people, dentophobia is so severe that they never see a dentist.The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognizes dentophobia as a specific phobic disorder, which is a type of anxiety disorder. Seeing a mental health professional can help you overcome this fear. You should also let your dentist know about your phobia. They can take steps to help you feel more comfortable so you get the dental care you need.A note from Cleveland ClinicAs an adult, you only have one set of teeth. No one wants to risk losing them to advanced gum disease. Thankfully, tooth scaling and root planing can save your smile if you develop periodontitis.Only a dental professional has the necessary tools and expertise to remove the tartar that causes periodontal disease. But daily brushing and flossing can keep your teeth and gums healthy. To lower your chances of another bout of gum disease, ask your provider to show you how to properly brush, floss and take care of your teeth.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 08/11/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
