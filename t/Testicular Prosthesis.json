An implant can be used for men who are born without a testicle or those who have lost a testicle because of an injury or illness. The implant's purpose is only to improve appearance and calm psychological fears; it doesn't function like a real testicle.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookOverviewWhat is a testicular prosthesis?A prosthesis is any artificial device used to replace a body part. For many people, the first type of prosthesis that probably pops into their mind is one for a missing leg or arm. However, there are other types of prosthesis available. When a male is either born without a testicle or must have one removed because of an injury or disease, a testicular prosthesis can be used to fill in the empty space in the scrotum. The scrotum is the sac that holds the testicles.A prosthesis is used only to improve appearance and calm psychological fears. It doesn\u2019t have any functions of a real testicle. More often than not, requests for a testicular prosthesis come from men who are born with a testicle and later lose it, rather than someone who's always been missing a testicle.Testicular prostheses have been in use since the 1940s. In the past, they were made of a variety of materials. Now, they are mainly made of silicone rubber and are filled with either silicone gel or saline (salt water). A testicular prosthesis will have the weight, shape and feel similar to a normal testicle. It\u2019s also available in different sizes so that a good match can be made to your body.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
