A tubal ligation blocks your fallopian tubes so that an egg and a sperm can\u2019t meet. As a result, fertilization can\u2019t take place.After tubal ligation, the only options for becoming pregnant is either tubal ligation reversal surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF). You don\u2019t need fallopian tubes to become pregnant with IVF. Both options have their pros and cons.Tubal ligation reversal is surgery to undo a tubal ligation. A tubal ligation reversal reconnects or reopens your tubes, creating a passageway for eggs and sperm to unite so that conception can occur. It reverses a tubal ligation, allowing you to become pregnant again.Tubal ligation reversal is also called tubal reversal, tubal sterilization reversal and tubal reanastomosis.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho\u2019s a good candidate for tubal ligation reversal?You\u2019re a good candidate for tubal ligation reversal if there\u2019s a good chance you can become pregnant after surgery. The likelihood of success depends on multiple factors, including:Your age. Your chance of getting pregnant naturally decreases with age. Younger age is associated with higher pregnancy rates and lower risks for miscarriage and having a baby with a congenital disorder.Other infertility causes. Irregular periods, uterine fibroids, scarring in your pelvis or endometriosis (a condition where the tissue lining your uterus is also present outside of your uterus) may reduce your chances for success after a tubal ligation reversal.Your partner\u2019s sexual health. The health of your partner\u2019s sperm influences whether you\u2019re a good candidate for surgery.Your tubal ligation procedure. The type of tubal ligation you had will determine how successful tubal reversal will be. Tubal ligation procedures where your healthcare provider uses clips or rings to tie your tubes are easier to reverse than procedures that involve burning your fallopian tubes (electrocautery).Your fallopian tube length. Your healthcare provider will need an adequate length of healthy fallopian tube segments to work with to reconnect your tubes.What types of tubal ligation can't be reversed?If most or all of your fallopian tube has been removed or the end of the tube cut off, reversal isn\u2019t possible. Essure\u00ae and Adiana\u00ae are sterilization devices previously marketed as non-surgical alternatives to tubal ligation. They involved inserting devices through your vagina and into your fallopian tubes, creating a blockage to prevent sperm from reaching an egg. Both have been taken off the market (Adiana\u00ae in 2012 and Essure\u00ae in 2019). The effects of these devices on your fallopian tubes can\u2019t be reversed.See your healthcare provider if you\u2019ve used these products and wish to become pregnant.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before tubal ligation reversal?Your healthcare provider will explain the procedure and review any risks. They\u2019ll perform the following to ensure you\u2019re a good candidate for surgery:Medical history. Your provider will perform a thorough review of your medical history. They\u2019ll ask about your pregnancy history, tubal ligation surgery and any other pelvic surgeries.Semen analysis.

You\u2019ll be able to go home the day of your operation.The procedure your healthcare provider uses will determine what happens during surgery. With mini-laparotomy, your provider makes a single 2-inch side to side incision just below your bikini line and performs the surgery through the cut using an operating microscope. With robotic-assisted laparoscopy, your provider operates a console that controls the robotic arms that perform surgery through several small incisions in your abdomen.During surgery, your healthcare provider will:Administer general anesthesia so that you\u2019re asleep during the procedure.Insert a thin tube called a catheter into your bladder to collect your pee during surgery.Make a single incision or several smaller incisions to access your fallopian tubes.Assess whether your tubes can be reconstructed. If tubal reversal is an option, your surgeon will immediately proceed with surgery. They\u2019ll open the blocked ends of your tubes and reconnect the segments of your fallopian tubes.Inject dye through your uterus to check if your fallopian tubes are open.Close your incisions with dissolvable sutures under your skin and place a bandage over the surgery site.Is tubal reversal painful?You\u2019ll be asleep during the procedure, which means you won\u2019t feel any pain.

After the procedure, you\u2019ll experience soreness at the surgery site.What happens after surgery?You\u2019ll remain in the hospital for approximately two hours after surgery. In that time, your healthcare provider or care team will monitor you to ensure you\u2019re safe to go home. Before you leave the hospital, your provider will give you medicine for pain, nausea or vomiting, as needed.

As with any operation, however, complications can occur, including:Infection.Bleeding or blood clots.Allergic reaction to anesthesia.Damage to other organs during surgery.A tubal ligation reversal can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy, but your overall risk is still very low. Ectopic pregnancies occur in 2% to 7% of pregnancies following a tubal reversal. With an ectopic pregnancy, a fertilized egg (embryo) implants in your fallopian tube instead of in your uterus. An ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that requires your healthcare provider\u2019s attention.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the success rate of tubal ligation reversal?The pregnancy rate following tubal ligation reversal varies from 50% to 80%. Successful surgery depends on many of the same factors that shape whether you\u2019re a good candidate for surgery, like your age and the length of your fallopian tubes following your tubal ligation. Your surgeon\u2019s skill will also impact your surgery\u2019s success.What is the recovery time?Most people resume normal activities within a week or two.

You\u2019ll need to wait two menstrual cycles before trying to get pregnant.How can I get pregnant without tubal ligation reversal?IVF is the other option for getting pregnant after a tubal ligation. It also has a high pregnancy rate but doesn\u2019t involve any surgery. The disadvantages are that it involves many complex steps. For example, it requires about 10 days of injecting fertility drugs and several office visits for monitoring with ultrasounds and blood work.Your fertility doctor may recommend IVF if you\u2019re not a good candidate for tubal reversal, or you may choose IVF if you prefer that to surgery.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I see my healthcare provider?A follow-up appointment will be scheduled with your surgeon a week or two following surgery. You\u2019ll receive instructions on when to call if you have any problems before that visit. You should call as soon as you have a positive pregnancy test so you can be evaluated for a possible tubal pregnancy. Your provider may schedule an x-ray dye test (HSG) a few months after your procedure to make sure your fallopian tubes remain open.A note from Cleveland ClinicTubal ligation reversal may be an option if you\u2019ve had a tubal ligation but would now like to try for a baby. Before proceeding with surgery, your healthcare provider will make sure you\u2019re a good candidate for the procedure. Depending on factors like your age and the condition of your fallopian tubes, IVF may be a better option. Either way, a tubal ligation doesn\u2019t have to mean you can\u2019t have a baby. Ask your provider about what course of action is best for you.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 09/01/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
