Healthcare providers often use transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to examine the prostate gland in men or people assigned male at birth (AMAB). They sometimes also use TRUS to look at the pelvic and reproductive organs in women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB).During a transrectal ultrasound, your healthcare provider inserts a probe into your rectum. This probe gives off high-energy sound waves. These waves (echoes) travel through your rectum and bounce off other organs and tissues. The echoes create computerized images that your provider can see on a video screen.Other names for a transrectal ultrasound include:Endorectal ultrasound (ERUS).Prostate sonogram.Prostate ultrasound.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
