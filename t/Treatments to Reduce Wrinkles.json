Similar to the creases in a shirt that needs ironing, wrinkles can form on your skin \u2014 most often on your face, neck, hands and arms. They can look like folds or ridges on your skin.

PolicyWhat causes wrinkles?There are many factors that contribute to the onset of wrinkles, including:Aging: As you get older, your skin cells divide slowly, which causes the outer layer of your skin to thin and wrinkles to form. You also lose about 1% of your collagen each year starting in your 30s.Facial muscle contractions: You use the facial muscles in your body to smile, frown or squint. Over time, these muscles cause frown lines between your eyebrows and crow\u2019s feet at the corners of your eyes because of weakened fat or bone mass and the effects of gravity on your skin.Sun damage: Exposing your skin to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause your skin to age prematurely. The sun can damage collagen in your skin, which provides the elasticity and flexibility your skin needs to prevent wrinkles.Smoking: Tobacco products cause your body to slow down its production of collagen. Too little collagen causes wrinkles.What are the treatment options for wrinkles?Since wrinkles are a normal part of your body\u2019s aging process, they don\u2019t need treatment. If you don\u2019t like how wrinkles look on your skin, there are treatment options available to cosmetically improve your appearance.RetinoidsRetinoids that include retinol, retinal aldehyde (Retin-A), retinyl esters, adapalene, tazarotene and tretinoin are chemicals that come from vitamin A that help reduce lines and wrinkles in your skin and improve your skin\u2019s texture, pigment and hydration levels. You can find retinol in many over-the-counter skin care products. Retinol can penetrate deep into your skin\u2019s layers to activate collagen and elastin, which give your skin structure and support to prevent wrinkles. You can apply products that contain retinoids at home directly onto your skin as you would a lotion or a moisturizer. Check with your healthcare provider to make sure products that include retinoids are right for you.Micro-needlingMicro-needling, or skin needling, is a facial rejuvenation procedure that uses a device with several tiny needles that poke you to create a miniature wound in the top layer of your skin (epidermis). This wound heals within minutes and causes new collagen and elastin to form as your skin heals. Micro-needling is effective at improving wrinkles or fine lines in your skin.MicrodermabrasionMicrodermabrasion gently removes or sands away thick or uneven outer layers of your skin. This treatment is best to treat scarring or stretch marks, skin discoloration or sun damage.DermabrasionDermabrasion scrapes away layers of your skin. This treatment removes skin layers to reduce wrinkles or irregular skin depressions. This helps you regain smoother, more youthful-looking skin.Chemical peelsChemical peels dissolve skin imperfections using small amounts of a chemical solution. The solution removes the top layers of your skin and makes room for new, healthy skin to grow in its place. Chemical peels are best to treat wrinkles, skin discoloration or scars.Laser skin resurfacingLaser skin resurfacing reduces facial wrinkles and irregularities caused by sun damage or acne. The laser technique directs short, concentrated pulsating beams of light at sections of your skin.

They block the chemical signals that cause your muscles to contract. Your healthcare provider will inject these medicines into the muscles whose contractions cause wrinkles, such as between your eyebrows (frown lines) and the lines that extend from the corners of your eyes (crow's feet).FillersWrinkles that remain at rest may require filler to fill in or lift skin with deep wrinkles. Prominent folds around your mouth, nose and chin are the most commonly treated. Hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring sugar polymer, is the most common filler.FaceliftA facelift is a surgical procedure where your healthcare provider will remove excess skin and fat from your face and neck.
