It\u2019s used to test the fluid for infection or other illnesses and to relieve chest pressure that makes it tough to breathe. Thoracentesis is a short, low-risk procedure done while you\u2019re awake.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewDuring a thoracentesis, your provider will insert a needle between your ribs to drain fluid from around your lungs (pleural space).What is thoracentesis?Thoracentesis is a procedure that takes fluid out from around your lungs (pleural space). The pleural space is the area outside your lungs but inside your chest wall.Your lungs and chest wall are both lined with a thin layer called pleura. A small amount of fluid between these two layers helps them move smoothly past each other when your lungs get bigger and smaller as you breathe. Just like a hinge needs oil to help the door move smoothly, your lungs need pleural fluid to help you breathe.Some medical conditions and diseases cause fluid to leak into the pleural space (pleural effusion), which makes it hard to breathe. Healthcare providers use thoracentesis to test the fluid for diseases or to relieve symptoms.What\u2019s the difference between thoracentesis and paracentesis?Thoracentesis and paracentesis both remove extra fluid from your body. Thoracentesis removes fluid from your chest and paracentesis removes fluid from your abdomen.What\u2019s the difference between a thoracentesis and a chest tube?Thoracentesis drains fluid from your chest during the procedure, which usually lasts about 15 minutes. A chest tube, or a smaller drain with a curled end (pigtail catheter), stays inside your chest and drains fluid or air over a few days. It\u2019s placed by a surgeon, pulmonologist or radiologist.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

Your provider will have you sit with your arms resting on a table.
