PolicyTracheotomy vs. tracheostomy: What\u2019s the difference?Technically, the term tracheotomy refers to the incision (cut) that your surgeon creates in your windpipe. The term tracheostomy refers to the opening itself. (This opening is also called a stoma.) However, most healthcare providers use the two terms interchangeably.Who needs to have a tracheostomy?You may need a tracheostomy if you:Have an obstruction in your upper airway (nose, mouth or throat).Have difficulty swallowing.Have trouble breathing due to injury, swelling or lung conditions.Undergo airway reconstruction following surgery on your larynx (voice box) or pharynx (throat).Need mechanical ventilation (breathing machine) for more than a week.AdvertisementIs a tracheostomy permanent?When your tracheostomy is no longer necessary, your healthcare provider can remove your tracheostomy tube. The hole often closes on its own. But if it doesn\u2019t, your surgeon can close it up.What is a tracheostomy tube?A tracheostomy tube is a catheter that\u2019s inserted into your windpipe once your surgeon creates the hole. It helps move air into your lungs.There are many different types of tracheostomy tubes. Your healthcare provider can help you find one that\u2019s right for you.AdvertisementCan you breathe on your own with a tracheostomy?Yes. Many people can breathe on their own with a tracheostomy.

Ask your healthcare provider if you\u2019re a candidate.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a tracheostomy?Your healthcare provider will tell you how to prepare for your tracheostomy procedure.

Once you\u2019re comfortable, your surgeon will create an incision (cut) in your neck, just below your Adam\u2019s apple. This incision will also go through your trachea (windpipe). Next, your surgeon will open the hole wide enough to fit a tracheostomy tube inside of it.Once your tracheostomy tube is in place, your surgeon will secure it with a band that goes around your neck. This keeps the tube in place during your recovery.If you\u2019re unable to breathe on your own, your surgeon will hook your tracheostomy tube up to a ventilator (breathing machine).What happens after a tracheostomy?After your tracheostomy, your medical team will watch your progress to ensure a successful recovery. Until you can meet with a speech-language pathologist, you\u2019ll communicate through writing.Your healthcare provider will give you post-operative instructions, which will tell you how to care for your surgical site and how to clean your tracheostomy tube.
