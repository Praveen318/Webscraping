PolicyWhat conditions do tetracyclines treat?Tetracyclines can treat several kinds of bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are any illness or condition caused by bacterial growth. You can get sick from getting harmful bacteria in your skin, gut (gastrointestinal tract), lungs, blood or anywhere else in your body.Harmful bacteria from the environment, an infected person or animal, a bug bite or something contaminated (like food, water or surfaces) can cause infections. A bacterium that\u2019s not normally harmful but that gets into a place in your body where it shouldn\u2019t be can also cause an infection.Bacterial infections that tetracycline can treat include (but aren\u2019t limited to):Acne.Actinomycosis.Amebiasis.Anaplasmosis (an infection you get from a tick bite).Brucellosis.Chlamydia.Early Lyme disease.Ehrlichiosis.Legionnaires\u2019 disease.Leptospirosis.Melioidosis.Pelvic inflammatory disease.Pneumonia and other bacterial respiratory tract infections.Rickettsial infections (Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus).Staph infections.Syphilis.Traveler\u2019s diarrhea.Tularemia.Whipple\u2019s disease.Healthcare providers may also prescribe tetracyclines to treat certain types of food poisoning and anthrax if you can\u2019t take penicillin.Other conditionsHealthcare providers sometimes prescribe tetracyclines for conditions that aren\u2019t bacterial infections. These include:Rosacea.Sarcoidosis.Kaposi sarcoma.Pyoderma gangrenosum.Hidradenitis suppurativa.Sweet syndrome.Rheumatoid arthritis.Scleroderma.Procedure DetailsHow do I take a tetracycline?Most tetracyclines come in pill form. But they also come in the form of topical creams and intramuscular and IV injections. Your healthcare provider will give you specific instructions on how to take the medication. Be sure to follow them.Some tetracyclines require you to take them on an empty stomach (without eating). This is because food can affect how well they work when they enter your body.In addition, calcium, aluminum, iron and magnesium negatively affect how tetracyclines work. It\u2019s important to tell your healthcare provider about any other medications or supplements you take. Many multivitamins, antacids and laxatives have high amounts of these substances. Your provider may ask you to stop taking them while taking a tetracycline antibiotic.How long will I need to take a tetracycline antibiotic?The length of time you\u2019ll need to take the antibiotic will depend on the reason for taking it and other factors, like your overall health. Your healthcare provider will let you know how long you need to take it.Be sure to complete your course of antibiotics \u2014 even if you start to feel better before you\u2019re finished with them. You need to take the medication regularly until the prescription is complete to make sure it kills all the harmful bacteria or prevents them from multiplying.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of tetracyclines?Tetracycline antibiotics can treat a broad range of bacterial infections. They\u2019re relatively safe, and healthcare providers commonly prescribe them.What are the side effects of tetracyclines?Common side effects of tetracycline antibiotics include gastrointestinal issues, like:Abdominal discomfort.Nausea and vomiting.Diarrhea.Decreased appetite.Some people have sun sensitivity (photosensitivity) while taking the medication. This can result in an exaggerated sunburn reaction, like skin blistering. Be sure to use extra sun protection (like sunscreen or wearing long sleeves) when taking tetracyclines.Rare side effects of tetracyclines include:Issues with liver function (hepatotoxicity).Worsening kidney failure (if you already have it).Esophageal strictures and ulcers.Intracranial hypertension (increased pressure around your brain).Lastly, all antibiotics can contribute to the development of diarrhea related to a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, including tetracyclines.AdvertisementWhat are the risks or complications of tetracyclines?Tetracycline antibiotics are generally safe, but there are some risks to consider, including:Tooth discoloration.Antibiotic resistance.Tooth discolorationBe sure to tell your healthcare provider if you\u2019re pregnant or think you might be pregnant. Tetracyclines cross the placenta and can affect the bones of a fetus. They can also cause permanent discoloration of the fetus\u2019s teeth.These antibiotics can also cause tooth discoloration in children under the age of 8. Because of this, providers don\u2019t generally prescribe tetracyclines to children in this age group unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.Antibiotic resistanceResearchers and healthcare providers have a growing concern over bacterial strains that are resistant to tetracycline antibiotics.Antibiotic resistance happens when bacteria change, so antibiotic medicines can\u2019t kill them or stop their growth. As a result, bacterial infections become extremely difficult to treat.Your body doesn\u2019t develop antibiotic resistance \u2014 bacteria do. When antibiotic resistance happens, fewer antibiotics are effective against a particular bacterium. Other antibiotics often help, but it\u2019s important to have as many treatment options available as possible. Your provider will choose the best antibiotic for you and will follow up to make sure it\u2019s working.It\u2019s important to remember that antibiotics (like tetracyclines) don\u2019t work for the common cold, flu or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when you don\u2019t need them increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists treatment. Only take an antibiotic when your provider prescribes it for you.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my healthcare provider?If you\u2019re taking a tetracycline antibiotic, call your healthcare provider if:You have any questions about taking your medication.You experience unpleasant side effects.Your symptoms from the infection aren\u2019t getting better.A note from Cleveland ClinicTetracyclines are a common and generally safe type of antibiotic that treat many bacterial infections. As with all antibiotics, it\u2019s important to finish your course of the medication. If you have any questions or concerns about the medication, reach out to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. They\u2019re available to help you.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 08/28/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
