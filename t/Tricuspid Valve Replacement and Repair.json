It\u2019s on the right side of your heart, between the upper chamber (atrium) and lower chamber (ventricle). It ensures that blood flows in the correct direction from the right atrium down to the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three flaps, called leaflets, that open and close as blood flows through it.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs to have tricuspid valve replacement or repair?Some people have health conditions that affect the tricuspid valve\u2019s function, called tricuspid valve disease. The main types are:Tricuspid regurgitation: The valve leaks or doesn't close tightly enough, allowing blood to leak backward.Tricuspid stenosis: The valve\u2019s leaflets are too stiff, which can restrict blood from flowing.When the tricuspid valve doesn\u2019t function correctly, your heart may have to work harder to supply your body with blood. This can cause bothersome symptoms and lead to complications, such as heart failure.Is it better to repair or replace the tricuspid valve?In general, healthcare professionals recommend repair using your own heart tissue whenever possible. But if the valve and surrounding tissue are too damaged, your healthcare professional may recommend a replacement valve.There are two types of replacement valves: biological and mechanical. A biological valve may come from an animal or deceased human donor. A mechanical valve is a manufactured medical device.If you receive a valve from an animal or human donor, you may not need to take blood thinners afterward. But mechanical valves increase the risk of blood clots, so you will need to take blood thinners for life.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before tricuspid valve repair or replacement?Before surgery to repair or replace your tricuspid valve, your doctor and treatment team will:Explain what to expect before, during and after surgery.Discuss potential risks of the surgery.Allow you to ask questions.Have you sign a form giving consent for surgery.Help you plan for your recovery, including medications and any help you\u2019ll need at home.They may conduct tests to ensure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery and to plan the procedure.
