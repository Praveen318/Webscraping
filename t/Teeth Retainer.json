This device keeps your teeth in proper alignment for years to come. For best results, always follow your provider\u2019s recommendations for wearing a retainer.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional DetailsOverviewA teeth retainer helps your teeth stay in their corrected position after wearing braces.What is a retainer?A teeth retainer is a custom-made device you wear in your mouth over your teeth. It helps keep your teeth in their new, correct position after braces.What do retainers do for teeth?Even after braces made your teeth straight, they aren\u2019t completely firm in their new position. This doesn\u2019t happen until the gums, bones and muscles get used to the change. Everyday habits like chewing and grinding apply forces to your teeth and can move them. Shifting teeth can also lead to malocclusion. This is when your upper and lower teeth don\u2019t align with your mouth closed.Your braces kept your teeth in a straight position for a long time. Once the braces come off, nothing is keeping your teeth from moving back to their previous position. Wearing a retainer helps keep your teeth in the correct place, so they don\u2019t move. Think of it this way: Braces straighten your teeth, but your retainer keeps them that way. They help your teeth \u201cretain\u201d their position.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

Orthodontists are dentists who have special training in the correct alignment of teeth.What are the different types of teeth retainers?The two main types of retainers are:Fixed retainers that stay in your mouth.Removable retainers that you take out.Many dental providers use a combination of fixed and permanent retainers to keep teeth straight. You could have both types at the same time. The purpose of all types of retainers is to make your alignment last for years.What are fixed retainers?Fixed retainers (also called permanent retainers) stay on your teeth with a glue-like bonding agent. You can\u2019t remove this type of retainer yourself. These are often used on the front, lower or upper teeth to keep them from coming apart or shifting over time.What are removable retainers?Removable retainers can go in and out of your mouth. Traditional (Hawley) retainers have a piece of wire attached to plastic (or acrylic). Clear retainers (Essix) are also plastic but don\u2019t have any wires. Both are custom-made to fit your teeth.Procedure DetailsHow are teeth retainers fitted?The process for making the retainer for your teeth depends on which type you get.For removable retainers:Your provider takes a dental impression of your teeth using dental putty, a soft material similar to play dough.They put the putty in trays, then insert the trays over your teeth. This imprints your unique bite and teeth layout into the putty. It takes one or two minutes to take an impression of your mouth.A dental laboratory uses the mold to create a plastic (or acrylic) teeth retainer. You typically wait a week or more before getting the retainer.Note: Many dental offices take digital impressions. Digital impressions are an alternative to the traditional impressions mentioned above. During this process, your dental provider simply uses a handheld wand to capture images of your teeth and gums. Next, a computer software program stitches those images together, creating a three-dimensional model of your mouth.For fixed retainers:Your dental provider uses a metal wire to measure the correct placement on your teeth.They use glue to set the wire in place.This intricate process takes longer than creating an impression for a removable retainer. But you leave the dental office with your retainer in place. You don\u2019t have to wait for a laboratory to create the retainer.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dental CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of using a retainer?When your provider takes off your braces, your teeth are perfectly aligned.

If you don\u2019t wear your retainer, your teeth will shift and move. They can become crooked, crowded or misaligned. Or you can develop an overbite.

After that, you\u2019ll need to wear the teeth retainer at night (part-time) for the rest of your life.Can retainers move teeth back?If you stop wearing your retainer and your teeth move, going back to wearing the retainer might move the teeth back to their aligned position. But don\u2019t wait too long \u2014 the more your teeth shift, the harder it is to get the retainer to fit right.How do I take care of my retainer?Prevent your retainer from getting damaged or lost so it\u2019ll last a long time.

See your dentist or orthodontist if your retainer breaks.What if I lose my retainer?If you can\u2019t find your retainer, contact your dental provider to get a new one made.

Clear retainers tend to cost more.Some insurance carriers provide partial coverage for orthodontic treatment, while others don\u2019t. Check with your insurance provider for the specifics of what your policy covers.Can a retainer straighten my teeth?No, retainers don\u2019t straighten teeth like braces do. Teeth retainers can\u2019t apply the constant, steady force needed to move teeth into their correct positions.If you forgot to wear your retainer for a few weeks and your teeth have shifted, wearing it may help nudge your teeth back into their correct position. You\u2019ll probably feel some discomfort as the retainer slowly pushes your teeth back into alignment. This usually only works for subtle, short-term changes.My retainer no longer fits. What should I do?If your retainer is too snug or no longer fits, your teeth have probably shifted. There\u2019s nothing you can do to make your current retainer fit. Your dental provider can adjust it or make a new retainer.Why does my removable retainer smell?Bacteria can grow on a retainer just like it can grow inside of your mouth. The bacteria that cause bad breath can also create a nasty smell on your retainer. That\u2019s why cleaning your retainer every day is so important. If your retainer starts to smell, scrub it with soap, water and a soft toothbrush. Ask your dental provider if you can soak it in a special cleanser made for retainers.A note from Cleveland ClinicBraces gave you straight teeth, but a retainer makes them last.
