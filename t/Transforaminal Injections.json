When one of those nerve \u201croots\u201d (the end closest to your spinal cord) gets irritated and inflamed due to a damaged disc or other condition, it causes pain that can radiate from your back to your legs and feet.A steroid medication can help reduce the inflammation and alleviate the pain. It\u2019s injected into your back, into the area between your spine and spinal cord.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
