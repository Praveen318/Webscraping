Threads come in several different materials and lengths.Unlike a facelift, a thread lift is a nonsurgical procedure that creates subtle changes. It\u2019s often called a \u201clunchtime facelift\u201d because it\u2019s such a quick procedure with minimal downtime.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
