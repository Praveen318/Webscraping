Tubal ligation is safe and effective and can be done at any time.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewThe fallopian tubes can be blocked several ways during tubal ligation surgery (getting your tubes tied).What is tubal ligation?Tubal ligation, commonly referred to as \u201cgetting your tubes tied,\u201d is a surgical procedure that\u2019s very effective in preventing pregnancy. It involves cutting, blocking or sealing off your fallopian tubes to prevent your eggs from being fertilized by sperm. The term \u201ctubal\u201d refers to the fallopian tubes. \u201cLigation\u201d means to tie. Your fallopian tubes are cut and tied with a special thread (suture) or blocked during this procedure using a clamp, clip or band.Your reproductive system includes your vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. The fallopian tubes are on either side of your uterus and extend toward your ovaries. They receive eggs from your ovaries and transport them to your uterus. Sperm can no longer reach the egg and an egg can\u2019t reach sperm when the fallopian tubes are closed. This prevents you from becoming pregnant.This procedure is also called tubal sterilization or female sterilization. It\u2019s performed after vaginal childbirth or a Cesarean delivery (C-section), during another abdominal surgery or on its own. Tubal ligation can be difficult and expensive to reverse and doesn\u2019t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhy do people get their tubes tied?Tubal ligation is considered permanent birth control. It\u2019s about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. If you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to be pregnant or be pregnant ever again, getting your tubes tied is a safe and convenient form of contraception. It allows you to enjoy sex without worrying about pregnancy.In some cases, removal of your fallopian tubes is recommended for treating certain conditions. Your healthcare provider may also recommend it if you have a high chance of being a carrier of a specific gene mutation (BRCA) that\u2019s associated with ovarian cancer.Procedure DetailsHow do I know I am ready to get my tubes tied?You should carefully weigh your decision to undergo sterilization. Though tubal ligation has been successfully reversed in some people, the procedure is meant to be permanent.People who are unsure if they still want children should choose a reversible form of contraception, such as birth control pills, an intrauterine device (IUD) or a barrier method (such as a diaphragm).Your partner may also consider having a vasectomy, a method of sterilization that involves cutting and tying the vas deferens, a tube that transports sperm.AdvertisementHow do I get ready for tubal ligation surgery?Before the procedure, you should discuss your decision for tubal ligation with your healthcare provider. Make sure you understand the risks of sterilization, how the procedure will be performed and any special instructions.How is tubal ligation performed?Your fallopian tubes are cut and tied with special thread, closed shut with bands or clips, or sealed with an electric current during tubal ligation. It can be performed in three ways:Laparoscopic tubal ligationLaparoscopy enables your healthcare provider to complete tubal ligation by making two small incisions \u2014 one at your navel and one just above your public bone.First, an intravenous line (IV) will be inserted into a vein in your hand or arm. You\u2019ll be given a general anesthetic in the IV to relax your muscles and prevent pain during surgery.A small incision is then made near your navel. A laparoscope, a thin viewing tube about the width of a pencil, is passed through this incision, and your abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide to make your organs easier to view.Then, they insert a surgical instrument through a second small incision made at your pubic hairline. Your fallopian tubes are located and then sealed with a band, ring or clip. Sometimes, your healthcare provider will use an electric current, called electrocoagulation, to seal your fallopian tubes.After your provider seals your fallopian tubes, they remove the laparoscope and use dissolvable stitches to close the incisions.Laparoscopic sterilization is typically done as an outpatient procedure and can be performed at any time. The smaller incisions reduce recovery time after surgery and the risk of complications. In most cases, you can leave the surgery facility within four hours after laparoscopy.LaparotomyA laparotomy is a more extensive surgery that requires a larger abdominal incision and sometimes a day or two of recovery in the hospital. Your healthcare provider will make a two- to five-inch incision in your abdomen, then bring your fallopian tubes up through the incision. Next, the tubes are cut and closed off using bands, rings or clamps. Finally, your provider closes your abdomen with stitches.As this is an open abdominal surgery, the recovery time can take several weeks. Generally, this form of tubal ligation is considered outdated and invasive compared to more modern practices, except when it occurs after a C-section delivery. In that case, your provider uses the same incision to deliver your baby and perform tubal ligation.Mini-laparotomy tubal ligation (mini-lap)Unlike a laparotomy, a mini-laparotomy uses a smaller incision \u2014 this is why it\u2019s given the name \u201cmini\u201d laparotomy. This type of tubal ligation is typically done within 24 hours of a vaginal childbirth, when you\u2019re already under epidural anesthesia. However, it can also be done under spinal anesthesia if you didn\u2019t receive an epidural during labor.After you give birth, your provider locates your fallopian tubes and uterus just below your navel. If a provider performs a mini-lap outside of childbirth, they make the incision just above your public bone.Your healthcare provider locates your fallopian tubes, lifts them to the incision and closes them off using a special thread (suture). If the procedure isn\u2019t related to childbirth, your provider may use bands, rings or clamps. The incision will be closed with stitches that dissolve.AdvertisementIs getting my tubes tied a major surgery?It depends on how your surgeon performs a tubal ligation. Your healthcare provider will determine the best way to proceed with surgery based on your medical history or if you\u2019re having a tubal ligation immediately after childbirth.A laparoscopic tubal ligation is less invasive because it leaves a smaller incision and has a shorter recovery time. A mini-laparotomy is slightly more invasive than laparoscopy and typically performed just after giving birth. The most major tubal ligation surgery is a laparotomy because it involves making a large incision across your abdomen.What should I expect after getting my tubes tied?After your tubal ligation, you\u2019re taken to a recovery area for monitoring. If you\u2019ve had a laparoscopic tubal ligation, you may be allowed to go home within a few hours. If you\u2019ve had a mini-laparotomy or laparotomy, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight. If you get your tubes tied after giving birth, you\u2019ll already have planned a hospital stay.Some common restrictions you can expect after a tubal ligation are:Avoid lifting anything heavy for at least one or two weeks. If you gave birth just before your tubal ligation, it\u2019s usually recommended to wait at least four weeks to lift anything heavier than your baby.Don\u2019t drink alcohol or drive for at least 24 hours.You can resume showers as usual. Don\u2019t swim or take baths for at least two weeks after surgery to allow for the incision site to heal.Gas in your abdomen may cause discomfort in your neck, shoulders and chest for 24 to 72 hours after surgery. Try taking a warm shower, using a heating pad or walking.You may have mild nausea. Try eating a light evening meal on the day of surgery. Tea, soup, toast or crackers may help relieve nausea.Your abdomen may be swollen for several days after the surgery. You can take over-the-counter pain medication or prescription pain reliever as directed by your healthcare provider.Vaginal bleeding up to one month after surgery is typical. Many people don\u2019t have their next normal menstrual cycle for four to six weeks after surgery. When your normal cycle returns, you may notice heavier bleeding and more discomfort than usual.What are the side effects of having a tubal ligation?You\u2019ll have some pain in your abdomen and feel tired after the procedure. The type of anesthesia used and how the surgery was performed can also affect your symptoms. The most common side effects of tubal ligation are:Shoulder pain.Bloating.Abdominal cramps.Nausea.Sore throat (from the breathing tube).Dizziness.If you have pelvic pain that doesn\u2019t go away after a few days, or if you have a fever, contact your healthcare provider right away.Care at Cleveland ClinicSchedule a Tubal LigationFind a Doctor and SpecialistsRequest an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of getting tubal ligation?Highly effective and convenient: Tubal ligation is about 99% effective.

They can help treat your symptoms and rule out any serious complications.Recovery and OutlookHow long does it take to recover from a tubal ligation?Your recovery depends on your health and the type of surgery you had. You should be able to resume normal activities within a few days if you\u2019ve had a laparoscopic tubal ligation. If you had a tubal ligation after childbirth, the recovery will last a few weeks, as you\u2019re also recovering from giving birth. If you had another abdominal surgery or C-section along with tubal ligation, your recovery might be extended up to eight weeks.It\u2019s important to follow all post-operative instructions you\u2019re given. Your healthcare provider will schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure you\u2019ve healed and that there weren\u2019t any complications.Do you get your period after you get your tubes tied?Getting your tubes tied doesn\u2019t impact your menstrual cycle. You\u2019ll still get your period. It won\u2019t cause menopause either. If you had irregular periods before the tubal ligation, you\u2019ll likely have irregular periods again after sterilization.Can you get pregnant after you get your tubes tied?The chances of getting pregnant after a tubal ligation are low. Depending on how the fallopian tubes are closed, pregnancy rates within 10 years of having the procedure range from .4% to 1%.When to Call the DoctorWhen should I call my doctor after a tubal ligation?Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any of the following:Persistent nausea and vomiting for more than 24 hours.Temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.33 degrees Celsius) for more than 24 hours.Redness, swelling, drainage or bleeding around the incision.Heavy bleeding with clots or soaking a pad within two hours.Additional Common QuestionsWhere do my eggs go after tubal ligation?Your body will still go through the process of releasing an egg at ovulation even though the passage through the fallopian tubes is now closed off. The egg will become very small or break down and get absorbed by your body.What is the difference between a salpingectomy and tubal ligation?Salpingectomy is the removal of one or both of your fallopian tubes. Salpingectomy treats certain medical conditions of your fallopian tubes and prevents ovarian and breast cancers in people at a higher risk. Tubal ligation is when the fallopian tubes are permanently blocked to prevent pregnancy. Both procedures are forms of birth control that prevent pregnancy.How soon can I have sex again after I get my tubes tied?It\u2019s generally recommended to wait about a week to resume sexual activity.
