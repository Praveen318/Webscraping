Your prostate gland is only found in men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB), and wraps around your urethra (tube where urine comes out). If your prostate gets too large, it can interfere with urination.During TURP, your healthcare provider inserts a thin tool into your urethra. This tool has an electric current or laser that allows them to remove part of your prostate. Because the tool goes in through your urethra, you don\u2019t have any incisions.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhy is transurethral resection of the prostate done?TURP treats benign prostatic enlargement/hyperplasia (BPE/BPH), a condition where your prostate grows too large. BPH isn\u2019t cancer, and it happens to many men and people AMAB as they get older.With BPH, your prostate may press on your urethra, which can make it difficult to urinate. Symptoms of BPH include:Feeling a sudden need to urinate and being unable to wait.Having frequent urges to urinate every one to two hours.Kidney damage (in severe cases).Nocturia, or waking up frequently at night to urinate.Urinary retention, or an inability to completely empty your bladder.Urine stream that starts and stops involuntarily.Weak urine stream or trickling of urine.How common is transurethral resection of the prostate?About 150,000 men and people AMAB in the U.S. have TURP each year.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsWhat happens before transurethral resection of the prostate?Although TURP doesn\u2019t use incisions, you need general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia during the procedure. Your healthcare provider will discuss which anesthesia option is best for you.To prepare for anesthesia, you may need to stop eating and drinking several hours before your procedure. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medications and supplements you take, including blood thinners. Ask your healthcare provider whether you should stop taking any of them before your procedure.What happens during transurethral resection of the prostate?Your healthcare provider performs TURP in a hospital operating room or ambulatory surgery center (ASC). The procedure usually takes less than 90 minutes. You\u2019ll receive anesthesia so you won\u2019t feel any pain.During your procedure, your healthcare provider:Inserts a rectoscope (thin tool with a camera) into your urethra.Examines your prostate and removes excess tissue with a laser or electrical current.Uses fluid to temporarily flush the excess tissue into your bladder.Drains any excess tissue out of your bladder through your urethra.Removes the rectoscope.AdvertisementWhat happens after transurethral resection of the prostate?After your procedure is done, you go to a recovery area. Some people stay in the hospital for one to two days after TURP, others might be discharged the same day.During your hospital stay, you have a catheter (thin, flexible tube) in your urethra. The catheter helps ensure that urine flows freely after your surgery. Usually, your healthcare provider removes the catheter before you go home.Care at Cleveland ClinicUrology CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of transurethral resection of the prostate?Benefits of TURP include:Fast results: Most people notice an improvement in their urinary symptoms within a few days.Treats severe BPH symptoms: TURP may be helpful if you have moderate to severe urinary problems from BPH and medications haven\u2019t worked.

However, this procedure may not be your only option. New advances in BPH treatment include nonsurgical, minimally invasive procedures that have a shorter recovery than TURP.Your healthcare provider may recommend a BPH medication first. If medications don\u2019t work well, or if you have side effects to medications, you and your healthcare provider may discuss procedures like TURP to remove excess prostate tissue. The treatment you choose depends on your individual health history and your preferences. Together, you can create a BPH treatment plan that works for your needs and lifestyle.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/15/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
