Healthcare providers prescribe them for other conditions as well.TCAs are one of many classes of antidepressants. They were one of the first types of antidepressants invented and are considered \u201cfirst-generation\u201d antidepressants.Today, providers more commonly prescribe TCAs for off-label use than for depression. This is because there are other classes of antidepressants for depression that are generally safer and have fewer adverse side effects.Tricyclic antidepressants get their name from their chemical structure, which contains three rings with one side chain.What are the types of tricyclic antidepressants?The following are all the tricyclic antidepressants (and their brand names) that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat major depressive disorder:Amitriptyline (Elavil\u00ae, Vanatrip\u00ae).Amoxapine (Asendin\u00ae).Desipramine (Norpramin\u00ae).Doxepin (Silenor\u00ae, Sinequan\u00ae).Imipramine (Tofranil\u00ae, Tofranil-PM\u00ae).Nortriptyline (Aventyl\u00ae, Pamelor\u00ae).Protriptyline (Vivactil\u00ae).Trimipramine (Surmontil\u00ae).Clomipramine (Anafranil\u00ae) is another TCA that\u2019s FDA-approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in people aged 10 and older.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat conditions do tricyclic antidepressants help treat?Tricyclic antidepressants are FDA-approved to treat major depressive disorder and other depressive disorders. However, healthcare providers rarely choose TCAs as the first option for treating depression symptoms. This is because there are safer antidepressant options, such as SSRIs. Providers may only prescribe TCAs for depression if other antidepressants aren\u2019t working, since TCAs may be more effective for some people. One potential exception is OCD, as providers consider the TCA clomipramine to be the gold standard treatment.Providers more commonly prescribe TCAs for off-label use today. This means that the medication isn\u2019t FDA-approved to treat the condition, but research has shown the medication may be effective in treating it.The off-label (non-FDA) uses of TCAs include:Migraine prevention (prophylaxis).Insomnia.Anxiety disorders.Chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain conditions such as myofascial pain, diabetes-related neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia.Fibromyalgia.Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis).What\u2019s the difference between SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants?Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants are both classes of antidepressants. TCAs are considered \u201cfirst-generation\u201d antidepressants, and SSRIs are considered \u201csecond-generation\u201d antidepressants.They\u2019re both effective in improving the symptoms of major depressive disorder. But healthcare providers more commonly prescribe SSRIs than TCAs because TCAs cause more significant adverse side effects. In addition, overuse of TCAs can more easily result in toxicity and overdose.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow do tricyclic antidepressants work?Tricyclic antidepressants work by increasing the levels of norepinephrine (primarily) and serotonin in your brain. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters. Norepinephrine and serotonin play an important role in regulating your mood and behavior.Through this process, TCAs also block certain receptors in your body, which ultimately causes adverse side effects, such as dry mouth and urinary retention.Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe TCAs to manage chronic pain. Researchers think that TCAs relieve pain by blocking pain signals in your spinal cord and by blocking peripheral pain signals through complex anti-neuroimmune actions.How do you take tricyclic antidepressants?TCAs are available in the form of oral tablets, capsules and solutions.The dosages for each type of TCA vary. As TCAs have a high risk of adverse effects and toxicity, your healthcare provider will initially prescribe the lowest dose possible and gradually increase it if necessary.Care at Cleveland ClinicDepression TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the side effects of tricyclic antidepressants?Each type and brand of tricyclic antidepressant has its own side effects.
