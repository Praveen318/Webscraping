PolicyWhat is vocal cord paralysis?Vocal cord paralysis affects your voice box (larynx) in your throat. Your voice box has two vocal cords (also called vocal folds). These smooth muscles help you breathe, speak and swallow. When you talk or cough, air moves through your lungs and into your windpipe (trachea) and across your voice box. Your vocal cords vibrate as air passes through them. This is what produces the sound that\u2019s shaped into your voice.When you have unilateral vocal cord paralysis, one vocal cord doesn\u2019t move (paralysis). Sometimes, the movement is very weak.
