Using a blood vessel from another part of your body, a surgeon creates a bypass route for blood to go around blocked artery sections. This allows blood to keep flowing to your heart muscle.ContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorContentsArrow DownOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsRecovery and OutlookWhen to Call the DoctorOverviewWhat is triple bypass surgery?Triple bypass surgery reroutes blood around three blocked areas in your coronary (heart) arteries. A surgeon moves blood vessels from elsewhere in your body to your heart. This allows blood to flow through open blood vessels instead of trying to move through blocked ones.You may hear people refer to this surgery as a coronary artery bypass graft or CABG. It\u2019s usually an open-heart surgery.Can triple bypass surgery be minimally invasive?Yes, but in very select scenarios. Some people meet the criteria for a triple bypass surgery that requires only a 3-inch cut between their ribs. Others can have a robotically assisted operation that uses a few 2-inch cuts. However, these minimally invasive techniques aren\u2019t a good option for everyone and are only suitable for highly select people. These procedures typically don\u2019t use a heart-lung machine, which means your heart keeps beating during the surgery. A provider can tell you which method is best for your situation.Who needs to have triple bypass heart surgery?People who have coronary artery disease may need triple bypass surgery. It\u2019s most likely the best option for people with plaque (made up of fats and cholesterol) in three parts of their heart\u2019s arteries. They need this operation because they have plaque blockages in their arteries that supply blood to their heart muscle. These blockages can cause chest pain, shortness of breath and heart attacks.Why is triple bypass surgery done?People need triple bypass surgery because:They have 50% or more blockage in their left main vessel or 70% or more blockage in branch coronary arteries.A less invasive method (angioplasty) didn\u2019t work or a provider didn\u2019t recommend it because of the severity and complexity of the blockages.How common is triple bypass surgery?Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is one of the most common major surgeries. It can treat one or more blocked arteries in your heart. Triple bypass surgery is a type of CABG that involves three blocked areas.Worldwide, an estimated 44 people per 100,000 have a bypass surgery. In the United States, 79 people per 100,000 have the surgery.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
