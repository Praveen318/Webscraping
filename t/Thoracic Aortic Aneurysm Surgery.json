Your aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart throughout the rest of your body. It starts at your heart and extends through your chest and abdomen before it ends at your pelvis.Aneurysms occur when there is a weak spot in one of your arteries. This weakening can lead to ballooning or expansion in that section of your artery. Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are rare, affecting only about 1 in every 10,000 people.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWho needs thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?Not everyone needs surgery for a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Whether you need surgical treatment depends on several factors, including the aneurysm\u2019s size, your symptoms and your overall health.What are the types of thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?There are two procedures to treat a thoracic aortic aneurysm:Open thoracic aneurysm repair is an open surgery that requires a long incision along the side of your chest. Your surgeon removes the damaged portion of the aorta and replaces it with synthetic material (graft).Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a minimally invasive procedure. Your surgeon reaches your aorta by placing a small, hollow tube (catheter) through a blood vessel in your groin. They use the catheter to place a small mesh device (stent) that repairs the diseased portion of the aorta and restores proper blood flow.AdvertisementWhy is thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery done?Your provider may recommend thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery to lower your risk of an aneurysm rupture. TAAs don\u2019t always rupture. They are life-threatening if they do.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?Your provider uses imaging scans to decide if you need surgery for a thoracic aortic aneurysm. They often use CT scans to monitor the aneurysm size. Your provider may recommend surgery if the aneurysm is larger than 5.5 centimeters or has grown more than 0.5 centimeters in six months.Your provider will give you instructions to prepare for the procedure. They may prescribe medications for a few days leading up to your surgery. These medicines may lower your blood pressure or relax your blood vessels. If you take blood thinners (anticoagulants), you may need to stop for a period before the procedure.AdvertisementWhat happens during thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?In open thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, your surgeon:Makes a large incision along the side of your chest.Uses special tools to stop blood flow temporarily in the affected segment of your aorta.Replaces the damaged section of your aorta with a synthetic graft.Closes the incision with stitches.During TEVAR, your provider:Inserts a catheter and special wires through an artery in your groin.Guides the catheter to your thoracic aorta.Injects a contrast dye through the catheter so they can see your thoracic aorta clearly.Uses CT or X-ray guidance to position the stent accurately.Removes the catheter and wires and places a bandage over the incision area in your groin.What happens after thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?You move to the intensive care unit (ICU) for immediate recovery after open surgery. After a day or two, you\u2019ll move to another area of the hospital, where you\u2019ll stay for up to 10 days.You usually stay in the hospital for about three days after TEVAR surgery. You may have some mild bruising and pain. Your healthcare provider will give you medications to manage the pain if needed.Care at Cleveland ClinicAortic Disease TreatmentFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery?Thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery significantly reduces your risk of an aneurysm rupture, which is a life-threatening emergency.
