The dye is a contrast agent that makes the pictures easier to understand. The procedure can be used on one or both ureters.The \u201cretrograde\u201d means that the flow is going back into your system, rather than outward as liquid (urine) normally flows.

PolicyWhat is the difference between a retrograde pyelogram and an intravenous pyelogram?Another test, an intravenous pyelogram, is similar, but the dye is put into your vein instead of into your ureter. They involve using contrast dyes and both are used to show images of the upper urinary tract. A retrograde pyelogram is done when you\u2019re allergic to contrast media and it can\u2019t be injected into your vein.Intravenous pyelograms aren\u2019t used as often as they were. Providers now prefer to do computed tomography (CT) urograms to find bleeding, blockages or tumors.Why is a retrograde pyelogram done?Your provider might order a retrograde pyelogram if:You may have damaged your ureter.You may have a blockage or narrow spot in your ureter.You may have stones or tumors in your kidneys and ureters or bladder.Your provider needs to have a good image to place a stent or do a ureteroscopy.AdvertisementHow common are retrograde pyelograms?Retrograde pyelography was used in the past more often than it is now.

You may be asked to put your feet in stirrups or the operating table might be one that can be rearranged to make the procedure easier to do.When the anesthesia takes effect, your provider will begin with a cystoscopy that will allow them to place the tube used to inject the dye into the upper part of your urinary tract. The cystoscope and instruments will pass through your bladder from your urethra and then be positioned in one of your ureters.Taking care to avoid air bubbles, your provider will push the dye into your ureter. When the dye is completely in place, a team member will take a series of X-rays.If the retrograde pyelogram is part of another procedure, such as placing a stent or removing a stone, the procedure will continue. If not, the scope will be withdrawn and the anesthesia lessened.What happens after a retrograde pyelogram?You\u2019ll be taken to a recovery unit for monitoring until you\u2019ve come out of the anesthesia and your blood pressure and breathing are all fine.In recovery, healthcare providers will check your urine (pee) for signs of blood.
