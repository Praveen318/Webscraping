Responders to trauma such as fires, car accidents and crime scenes can be left with physical and mental problems. They witness human suffering, risk their personal safety, manage intense workloads, face life-and-death decisions and are often separated from their families. Programs and training to help them manage these stresses are critical in helping them stay healthy and able to stay on the job now and in the future.People with chronic conditions benefit from resilience training, as it can improve their ability to manage their own care and navigate an often unpredictable journey through life. This includes help for children with special needs, who not only have to face physical limitations but may also have to deal with teasing or even bullying from their peers.What does resilience training teach?Building resilience means learning to manage how stress affects you. It can apply to experiences before, during and after a stressful situation.BeforeKnow what you are facing to help you cope better with the stresses you will encounter in potentially traumatic events:Learn as much as possible about the situation(s) you will face and your role in them.Make a plan to stay in touch with your support network during difficult times.

A realistic plan lets everyone have the same expectations of when they may be in or out of reach.Think through what needs to be done at home and the office if you will be away.DuringTake care of yourself: take breaks, eat healthy foods, exercise and limit caffeine and alcohol consumption.Use the buddy system.

Don\u2019t be afraid to talk about your feelings or seek professional help through your employer or other resources.Here are a few tips to help ease you back in:Limit social activities to your family and closest friends for a while. Too much stimulation can be taxing.Understand that roles at home and at work may have altered while you were gone.
