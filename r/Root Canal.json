PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens during root canals?Before beginning treatment, your dentist or endodontist will take dental X-rays of the affected tooth. They may do other tests to determine if your tooth pulp is dead, infected or inflamed and confirm that you\u2019ll need a root canal. They may:Gently tap on your tooth or touch it with a cold or hot substance to check for sensitivity or discomfort.Do an electric pulp test (EPT) by using a device that sends a gradually increasing electric current through your tooth to see if your tooth pulp reacts.Check for signs of swelling in the gums and bone around your tooth.Ask if it hurts when you bite down on your tooth.During root canal treatment, your dentist or endodontist removes the inflamed pulp.

If you have dental anxiety, your provider may give you medications to help you relax.

Dental crowns are typically made to order, so it may be two or three weeks before this last step happens.What happens after a root canal?Your provider may suggest you rest for a few minutes before leaving the dental clinic or provider\u2019s office. It can take an hour or more for anesthesia to wear off, meaning your mouth and gums aren\u2019t numb anymore. Some people decide to rest at home while that happens while others choose to go on with their usual daily routine.Typically, you\u2019ll have two more appointments so a provider can prepare your tooth for a dental crown and then place the crown on your tooth.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Dental CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the potential benefits of root canals?Root canals eliminate tooth infections that, left untreated, could cause serious issues like:Infection that spreads to other teeth.Jawbone damage.What are the risks or complications of root canals?Sometimes root canals fail because they weren\u2019t the right solution for your tooth infection.
