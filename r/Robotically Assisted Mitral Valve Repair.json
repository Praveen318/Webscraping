They are the mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonic valves. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium (upper heart chamber) and the left ventricle (lower heart chamber).

We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat is valve disease?Valve disease occurs when your heart's valves do not work correctly. This can be caused by valve stenosis (stiff, fused, inflexible leaflets, limiting flow of blood) or valve regurgitation (leaky heart valve, occurs when the leaflets do not close completely). Learn more about valve disease.Mitral valve surgeryWhen the mitral valve does not function properly, the mitral valve must be repaired or replaced. At Cleveland Clinic, mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice for most patients with mitral valve disease. If you require mitral valve surgery, either repair or replacement, you may be a candidate for robotically assisted mitral valve surgeryRobotically-Assisted Valve Surgery: smaller incisionTraditional, open-chest surgeries, such as mitral and tricuspid valve surgery, and bypass surgery involve: placing the patient on the heart-lung bypass machine to circulate oxygenated blood during surgery; creating a 6- to 8-inch incision through the sternum; spreading the ribs to view the heart and stopping the heart in order to stabilize the blood vessels.Conventional minimally invasive surgery decreases the size of the incision to about 3 to 4 inches.Traditional open heart surgery incisionRobotically assisted surgery incisionThe minimally-invasive robotically-assisted technique uses even smaller incisions \u2013 often less than 2 inches. The surgeon\u2019s hands control the movement and placement of the endoscopic instruments to open the pericardium (thin sac that surrounds the heart) and to perform the procedure. In most cases, the sternum or breastbone does not need to be opened and the ribs do not need to be spread to perform the procedure.Procedure DetailsHow does robotically assisted heart surgery work?During mitral valve surgery, the surgeon is able to get an undistorted 3-D view of the mitral valve, leaflets and subvalvular structures with use of a high powered camera. and a lateral thoracic approach. The robotic surgical system is used to control instruments, which are attached to thin, robotic arms. The surgeon's hands control the movement and placement of the instruments. The robotic \u201carm and wrist\u201d movements mimic those of the surgeon's hand to enable the surgeon to follow the same steps as a traditional mitral valve surgery - including a variety of repair techniques and mitral valve replacement.Learn more about how robotically assisted heart surgery works.Care at Cleveland ClinicHeart Valve CareFind a Doctor and SpecialistsMake an AppointmentAdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of robotically-assisted surgery?Compared with traditional surgery, the benefits of robotically-assisted surgery include:Smaller incisions with minimal scarringLess trauma to the patient, including less painShorter hospital stay (usually 3 to 4 days)Decreased use of pain medicationsLess bleedingDecreased risk of infectionShorter recovery and quicker return to daily and professional activities: The patient can resume normal activities and work as soon as he or she feels up to it; there are no specific activity restrictions after robotically-assisted surgery.Additional DetailsInformation about Robotic surgery:Learn more how robotically assisted heart surgery worksMinimally Invasive Heart SurgeryHeart SurgerydaVinci\u00ae Cardiothoracic Surgery*Information about mitral valve disease treatments:Mitral valve repairMinimally Invasive Mitral Valve RepairOther robotically assisted heart surgeriesMitral valve repair surgeryTricuspid valve repair surgery (when combined with mitral valve surgery)Ablation of atrial fibrillation (if other robotic surgery is required)Atrial septal defect (ASD) repairPatent foramen ovale (PFO) repairRemoval of cardiac tumors (Myxoma, Fibroelastoma of the mitral or tricuspid valve)*The inclusion of links to other web sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on the web sites or any association with their operators.
