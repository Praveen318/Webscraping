During fetal development, the fetus doesn't use its own lungs for oxygen-rich blood. Instead, it relies on the birthing parent to provide oxygen-rich blood from the placenta through the umbilical cord. Therefore, blood can travel from the veins to the right side of the baby's heart and cross to the left side of the heart through the foramen ovale and skip the trip to the baby's lungs.Normally the foramen ovale closes at birth when increased blood pressure on the left side of the heart forces the opening to close.If the atrial septum does not close properly, it is called a patent foramen ovale. This type of defect generally works like a flap valve, only opening during certain conditions when there is more pressure inside the chest. This increased pressure occurs when people strain while having a bowel movement, cough, or sneeze.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

If a PFO does require treatment, particularly if associated with a stroke, it may be closed interventionally through a PFO closure device or through heart surgery.Robotically Assisted PFO Surgery: smaller incisionRobotically assisted atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair surgeries are performed through small incisions made in the right sight of the chest. The surgeon\u2019s hands control the movement and placement of the endoscopic instruments, which are used to retrieve a small patch of pericardial tissue.The pericardium is the thin sac that surrounds the heart. The tissue patch is used to repair the defect between the right and left atrium for ASD or PFO defects.AdvertisementRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of robotically assisted surgery?Compared with traditional surgery, the benefits of robotically assisted surgery include:Smaller incisions with minimal scarringLess trauma to the patient, including less painShorter hospital stay (usually 3 to 4 days)Decreased use of pain medicationsLess bleedingDecreased risk of infectionShorter recovery and quicker return to daily and professional activities: The patient can resume normal activities and work as soon as he or she feels up to it; there are no specific activity restrictions after robotically assisted surgeryResourcesWhich Cleveland Clinic physicians perform robotically-assisted heart surgery?Robotically-assisted surgery is performed by our specially trained cardiovascular surgeons.
