Septoplasty is a procedure similar to rhinoplasty that repairs the deep, internal structural complications within your nose \u2014 the nasal septum. Complications in the nasal septum can affect how you breathe. Both procedures can be done at the same time to improve both the look and the function of your nose.How common is rhinoplasty?Rhinoplasty is one of the most common cosmetic surgery procedures.
