If there is a large hole, oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium flows back into the right atrium and gets pumped back to the lungs again. This causes more work for the heart. If the hole is very small, it is generally termed a patent foramen ovale. In some cases, a patent foramen ovale can be associated with strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs, or \u201cmini-strokes\u201d).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsTreatment of ASDIf ASD does not close on its own, heart surgery is required to close the defect. In some cases, ASD may be closed interventionally through a closure device.Robotically-Assisted ASD Surgery: smaller incisionRobotically-assisted atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair surgeries are performed through small incisions made in the right sight of the chest.Robotically assisted surgery incisionThe surgeon\u2019s hands control the movement and placement of the endoscopic instruments, which are used to retrieve a small patch of pericardial tissue.The pericardium is the thin sac that surrounds the heart. The tissue patch is used to repair the defect between the right and left atrium for ASD or PFO defects.For more information:Learn how robotically assisted heart surgery worksRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of robotically assisted surgery?Compared with traditional surgery, the benefits of robotically assisted surgery include:Smaller incisions with minimal scarringLess trauma to the patient, including less painShorter hospital stay (usually 3 to 4 days)Decreased use of pain medicationsLess bleedingDecreased risk of infectionShorter recovery and quicker return to daily and professional activities: The patient can resume normal activities and work as soon as he or she feels up to it; there are no specific activity restrictions after robotically assisted surgeryAdvertisementAdditional DetailsFor more information about atrial septal defect (ASD):Atrial septal defect (ASD)Cardiac implant closure deviceMinimally Invasive Heart SurgeryHeart SurgeryResourcesWhich Cleveland Clinic physicians perform robotically-assisted heart surgery?Robotically-assisted surgery is performed by our specially trained cardiovascular surgeons.
