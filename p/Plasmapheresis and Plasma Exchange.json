Plasma is mostly water containing electrolytes (dissolved salts) and proteins. Some proteins in plasma protect us from foreign substances like cancer cells, viruses, fungi and bacteria. Other proteins help control bleeding.Plasmapheresis is the process healthcare providers use to obtain plasma from blood. Many times, providers do plasmapheresis to obtain donor plasma \u2014 plasma from healthy people that providers use when treating certain medical conditions.Plasma exchange is when providers use plasmapheresis to replace someone\u2019s plasma. They do that by taking blood and using a machine to separate the plasma from blood. Then, they replace the plasma with fluid, add the replacement fluid to the blood and return the blood to the person receiving treatment.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyWhat diseases are treated with plasmapheresis or plasma exchange?Healthcare providers use this process to treat a variety of blood disorders, neurologic disorders and blood cancers. They may use plasma exchange as a first-line or initial treatment or by combining it with other treatments. Providers may also use plasma exchange to support recovery from organ transplants.How do healthcare providers use this treatment to treat neurologic disorders?Providers may use plasma exchange to remove harmful antibodies from people\u2019s plasma. Those disorders include:Multiple sclerosis (MS): People who have MS use plasma exchange treatment to cope with sudden, severe symptoms caused by proteins in their plasma that are attacking their body.Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis happens when antibodies that are supposed to attack intruders begin to attack healthy tissue. Plasma exchange filters out the abnormal antibodies.Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: This condition happens when your immune system attacks your nerves. Plasma exchange filters out the antibodies in your plasma that are attacking your immune system.How do providers use this process to treat blood disorders?Providers treat the following blood disorders with plasma exchange:Cryoglobulinemia: This condition happens when proteins called cryoglobulins clump together in your blood, clogging your arteries and causing inflammation and organ damage. Providers use plasma exchange to remove cryoglobulins that otherwise may block your arteries.Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: People with this condition have blood clots in small arteries throughout their bodies.

They may use donor plasma without removing your blood.What types of cancer are treated with plasmapheresis and plasma exchange?Waldenstr\u04e7m macroglobulinemia (Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma): This is a blood cancer that happens when lymphoid cells in your bone marrow or lymph nodes produce unusually large amounts of the antibody immunoglobulin M. Providers use plasma exchange to filter the antibody from your plasma.Multiple myeloma: This is a blood cancer that happens when your bone marrow produces abnormal plasma cells that become cancerous and multiply. Providers use plasma exchange to remove the abnormal plasma cells.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before plasmapheresis and plasma exchange?If you\u2019re receiving plasma exchange, your healthcare provider may recommend you:Drink noncarbonated beverages, starting 72 hours before your treatment.Be sure to have something to eat about an hour before your treatment.Wear comfortable clothes and bring something to read or listen to during treatment.Have someone available to take you home after your treatment.AdvertisementWhat happens during plasmapheresis and plasma exchange?In plasmapheresis, healthcare providers obtain blood and use a machine to separate red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma to use each part of your donated blood to treat certain medical conditions.Plasma exchange takes a few more steps:Providers insert a needle or intravenous line into your arm or central line catheter.They gradually remove small amounts of blood.They use a machine to separate your plasma from your blood.They discard your plasma.They combine your blood with fluid, sometimes adding a protein called albumin, and return your blood to you via intravenous line or central line catheter.How much time does it take to do plasma exchange?A plasma exchange may take several hours.Is plasma exchange painful?No, it\u2019s not painful, but you may have some discomfort when healthcare providers place intravenous lines in your arms.

The plasma exchange process may remove calcium. Providers treat this side effect with intravenous calcium.Hypothermia: This is low body temperature. Providers may treat this side effect by infusing (pumping) warm fluids into your body via an intravenous line.Hypotension: This is low blood pressure. Providers may treat this with blood, fluid or plasma transfusions.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the recovery time?Most people recover from plasma exchange treatment within a few hours.How long will I feel better after treatment?That depends on why you\u2019re having plasma exchange.

They may have several treatments over a few weeks and feel stronger for a few months before needing additional treatments.Additional DetailsIs plasmapheresis the same as dialysis?Dialysis and plasmapheresis and plasma exchange operate on the same principle: Filtering harmful substances from your blood. People have dialysis because their kidneys aren\u2019t able to remove waste from their blood. That waste builds up in their bloodstream. In dialysis, providers use a machine to remove blood from your body, cleanse the blood and return it to you.A note from Cleveland ClinicHealthcare providers have used plasmapheresis and plasma exchange for decades. The medical practice of removing abnormal blood, including plasma, dates back centuries. Plasma exchange is part of the overall treatment for conditions including blood disorders, blood cancers and neurological diseases. Plasma exchange doesn\u2019t cure these conditions. It does, though, ease symptoms that may affect your quality of life. If you have a condition that may be helped by plasma exchange, ask your healthcare provider for more information.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 09/20/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
