These tiny glands, located on the back of your thyroid, help regulate the level of calcium in your blood. (Most people have four parathyroid glands, but rarely, a person can have more, fewer or none.)You might need parathyroidectomy surgery if you have hyperparathyroidism \u2014 when one or more of your parathyroid glands makes too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). Reasons for parathyroidectomy include:Parathyroid adenoma (a noncancerous growth on one or two of the parathyroid glands).Parathyroid hyperplasia (multiple enlarged parathyroid glands).Parathyroid cancer (very rare).You can also develop hyperparathyroidism because of another medical condition. Kidney disease is a common example. When this happens, healthcare providers call it secondary hyperparathyroidism.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Parathyroidectomy is a common, minimally invasive procedure that can improve (and in many cases, cure) hyperparathyroidism. If you develop new symptoms like joint pain, muscle weakness, fatigue and foggy memory, it could indicate overactive parathyroid glands. Let your healthcare provider know so they can determine a cause and recommend appropriate treatment.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 09/08/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
