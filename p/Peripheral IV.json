It\u2019s used to deliver treatments into a vein for different health conditions. They\u2019re the most commonly used intravenous (IV) devices in the healthcare setting. Up to 80% of people admitted to the hospital need IV access during their stay. Around the world, healthcare providers use more than 1 billion peripheral IVs every year. Other names for a peripheral IV include:Peripheral IV catheter.Peripheral venous catheter.Peripheral IV line.What is a peripheral IV used for?Healthcare providers use peripheral IV lines to draw blood and give treatments, including:IV fluids.Medications, such as antibiotics.Blood transfusions.Liquid nutrition (total parental nutrition).The most common peripheral IV sites include the back of your hand, inner elbow and foot. In infants, the scalp is the easiest placement. A peripheral line can remain in place for several days if needed. This can prevent the need for repeated needle sticks if you need ongoing treatment.Peripheral IV vs. PICC lineA PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line is a type of central venous catheter. Central venous catheters are similar to peripheral IVs, but they\u2019re longer and thicker. Healthcare providers use PICC lines to access the large veins in your chest when you need to get treatments through your veins over a longer period of time. Peripheral IVs are generally safer, easier to place and less painful than PICC placement.Midline vs. peripheral IVA midline is another kind of central venous catheter used when you need treatment for a longer period. They\u2019re half as long as PICC lines and extend to just below your collarbone. People who can\u2019t get PICC lines may get midlines instead.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before a peripheral line placement?Before a peripheral IV placement, a healthcare provider will ask to confirm your identity. They may also help put you at ease if you\u2019re anxious or have a fear of needles. Then, they\u2019ll have you rest the body part they\u2019re going to use on a comfortable surface.What happens during a peripheral IV insertion?A healthcare provider will use peripheral IV insertion guidelines to properly place a line. First, they\u2019ll wash their hands, put on a pair of gloves and look for a suitable vein to use. They prefer veins that are straight, away from the inner part of your body and not near points where the vein branches out. They\u2019ll likely apply a tourniquet (a stretchy band) and have you make a fist. They may gently tap (palpate) the area with their fingertips to look for a large, nonmoving vein, as they can shift or roll. If the provider can\u2019t easily find a vein, they may use a vein-finder device.Once they find a suitable vein, the provider may apply a topical anesthetic to numb the area. This is more common with children. If they apply an anesthetic, they\u2019ll remove the tourniquet while the numbing medicine takes effect. Then, they\u2019ll clean the site with an antiseptic swab and reapply the tourniquet.The provider will then hold the area still and taut with one hand and hold the needle and catheter in the other. The provider will give you a heads-up that a needle stick is about to happen, and then, they\u2019ll insert the needle into your skin at a shallow angle. The needle will move through your skin and into your vein. The provider will gently advance the catheter into your vein and then remove the needle and the tourniquet.AdvertisementWhat happens after peripheral IV placement?After the healthcare provider places the peripheral line, they\u2019ll carefully wipe down the area and cover the catheter with a see-through (transparent) dressing. They\u2019ll secure the tubing to your skin with tape, and they\u2019ll write the date and time on your dressing.Then, they can draw blood if needed for laboratory testing. And they\u2019ll attach the end of the IV tubing to the catheter and flush the line with saline to confirm adequate flow.How long does peripheral IV placement take?If a healthcare provider easily finds a suitable vein and has no problems with placement, the procedure should take less than a minute. If they have trouble finding a vein or have difficulty with insertion, the procedure could take longer. In addition, if the provider uses an anesthetic to numb the area, they may need to wait up to 30 minutes to attempt the placement.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of this procedure?Peripheral IVs are the most common type of intravenous line.
