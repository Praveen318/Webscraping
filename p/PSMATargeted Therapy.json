It uses a radioactive tracer (radiotracer) to target and destroy PSMA, which is a protein on the outside of prostate cancer cells.The prostate is a gland that rests below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. It\u2019s about the size of a walnut.Other names for PSMA-targeted therapy may include lutetium PSMA therapy and Lu177-PSMA (Pluvicto\u2122).What is PSMA?PSMA is a protein and an antigen. Antigens are substances that cause your immune system to respond. They include bacteria, viruses, allergens, tumor cells and even normal cells. Prostate cancer cells make PSMA.What conditions are treated with PSMA-targeted therapy?PSMA-targeted therapy treats advanced prostate cancer that doesn\u2019t respond to surgery or radiation, especially cancer that breaks away and forms new tumors in other parts of your body (metastatic prostate cancer).Does PSMA-targeted therapy cure prostate cancer?No, PSMA-targeted therapy doesn\u2019t cure cancer. PSMA-targeted therapy\u2019s goal is to reduce your symptoms, shrink your tumors and slow tumor growth.A cure means you no longer have prostate cancer, you don\u2019t need any more treatment and healthcare providers don\u2019t think it\u2019ll return. With PSMA-targeted therapy, you\u2019ll need follow-up care, regular check-ups and periodic testing. After treatment, you may have a longer remission period, which means you\u2019re symptom-free and tests show no signs of active cancer.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before PSMA-targeted therapy?Before PSMA-targeted therapy, most people have other standard prostate cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and chemical castration. If the cancer doesn\u2019t respond to these treatments, your healthcare provider may recommend PSMA-targeted therapy.Before starting treatment, your provider will review your medical history and perform a physical examination. Be sure to bring a list of your previous treatments, current medications and any questions you may have.Your provider will also order blood tests and imaging tests. Imaging tests may include:A CT (computed tomography) scan. A CT scan creates a 3D image of your soft tissues and bones.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses large magnets, radio waves and a computer to make detailed images of the soft tissues in your body.Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) scan. A PSMA PET is a type of PET scan that works like PSMA-targeted therapy. It uses a radiotracer to find and attach to PSMA proteins, which are then visible on the scan.These imaging tests work together to help your providers see exactly where prostate cancer cells reside in your body.What happens during PSMA-targeted therapy?During PSMA-targeted therapy, a healthcare provider uses a small needle to inject a standard PSMA dosage into a vein, usually in your arm. The PSMA therapy dose contains lutetium-177. Lutetium-177 is a radioactive chemical element that destroys prostate cancer cells. The PSMA therapy dose takes the lutetium-177 directly to your prostate cancer tumors so that the radiation will have minimum effect on other parts of your body.The injection process usually takes just a few minutes.The provider may give you medications that help treat nausea and vomiting.PSMA-targeted therapy is an outpatient procedure, meaning that you can go home the same day. Your providers will observe you after the procedure. Once they determine you\u2019re healthy enough after the treatment, you can go home.How long will I need PSMA-targeted therapy?You\u2019ll schedule treatments every six weeks for six total treatments.
