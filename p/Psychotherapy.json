It can provide support, education and guidance to you and/or your family to help you function better and increase your well-being.Psychotherapy may be used in combination with medication or other therapies or as a standalone treatment.What\u2019s the difference among psychotherapy, counseling and therapy?Many people use the words \u201cpsychotherapy,\u201d \u201ccounseling\u201d and \u201ctherapy\u201d to convey the same thing: talk therapy with a mental health professional to help resolve issues or treat mental health conditions.Although people often use \u201ctherapy\u201d as a shortened version of \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d (which is a correct substitution), it should be noted that psychotherapy specifically deals with mental, emotional and behavioral issues. There are several other types of therapy for various health conditions, such as speech therapy, physical therapy, hydrotherapy, radiation therapy and many more.Counseling is typically a brief treatment that targets a specific symptom or situation, such as marital or family issues, while psychotherapy is usually a longer-term treatment that attempts to gain more insight into someone\u2019s issues or help with a mental health condition. It\u2019s OK to use the terms interchangeably.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

PolicyWhat are the types of psychotherapy?Mental health professionals use several types of psychotherapy, and many professionals specialize in certain types. The choice of therapy type depends on your particular condition and/or circumstances. Therapists may combine elements from different therapeutic approaches to best meet your needs.Some of the more common types of psychotherapy include:Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This is a structured, goal-oriented type of psychotherapy. Mental health professionals use it to treat or manage mental health conditions and emotional concerns. Your therapist or psychologist helps you take a close look at your thoughts and emotions. You\u2019ll come to understand how your thoughts affect your actions. Through CBT, you can unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to adopt healthier thinking patterns and habits.Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): DBT is a type of talk therapy that\u2019s based on cognitive behavioral therapy, but it\u2019s specially adapted for people who experience emotions very intensely. The main goal of therapists who use DBT is to strike a balance between validation (acceptance) of who you are and your challenges and the benefits of change. Your therapist will help you learn new skills to improve emotion regulation. It involves both individual and group therapy.Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This is a short-term form of therapy. It helps you understand underlying interpersonal issues that are troublesome, like unresolved grief, changes in social or work roles, conflicts with others and issues relating to others. It can help you learn healthy ways to express emotions and ways to improve communication.Psychodynamic therapy: This type of therapy is based on the idea that behavior and mental well-being are influenced by childhood experiences and problematic repetitive thoughts or feelings that are outside of your awareness (they\u2019re unconscious). You\u2019ll work with a therapist to improve your self-awareness and change old patterns so you can more fully take charge of your life.Additional therapies that mental health professionals sometimes use in combination with psychotherapy include:Animal-assisted therapy: This involves working with dogs, horses or other animals to bring comfort, help with communication and help cope with trauma.Creative arts therapy: This involves the use of art, dance, music and poetry to aid with talk therapy and communication.Play therapy: This therapy specifically helps children identify and talk about their emotions and feelings through play.There are also different types of therapy depending on who\u2019s taking part in the session. These include:Individual therapy: This therapy involves only you and the mental health professional.Group therapy: This therapy happens when two or more people participate in therapy with a mental health professional at the same time. In group therapy, you\u2019re able to share experiences and learn from others about their similar experiences.Marriage counseling/couples therapy: This therapy involves you and your spouse or romantic partner. Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT) are specifically trained to help couples determine their problems and work on solutions. Issues may be related to communication, raising children, finances, understanding your or your partner\u2019s mental health condition and more.Family therapy: This therapy involves you and your family members \u2014 either all of them or some of them. It can help family members improve communication and resolve conflicts, which can range from sibling jealousy to issues with coping with the death of a family member.Who needs psychotherapy?Psychotherapy can benefit anyone who\u2019s struggling with life\u2019s challenges, excessive stress, adjusting to a new life situation or medical condition and/or who has a mental health or behavioral condition.

It provides a supportive, non-judgmental and safe environment that allows you to talk openly with a mental health professional who\u2019s objective and specially trained to help you with the issues you\u2019re having.During sessions, you and your mental health professional will work together to identify and change thoughts and behaviors that are preventing you from living your best life. The frequency between sessions will vary, depending on the condition that you\u2019re being treated for, your lifestyle and your therapist\u2019s practice.As conversation is the main part of psychotherapy, you need to be actively involved in the therapy. The trust and relationship between you and your therapist are essential to working together effectively and benefiting from the therapy.Mental health professionals prioritize confidentiality and maintaining your privacy. In fact, it\u2019s a part of their professional code of ethics. Mental health professionals who violate patient confidentiality risk losing their ability to practice therapy in the future.However, if you reveal that you plan to hurt yourself or others, your mental health professional is duty-bound to report that to authorities for your protection and/or the safety of others. They must also report abuse, exploitation or neglect of children, the elderly or people with disabilities.You can always give your mental health professional written permission to share all or part of your discussions with your primary healthcare provider, family members, teachers or anyone else if you want.Care at Cleveland ClinicMental Health CareMake an AppointmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the benefits of psychotherapy?Research shows that about 75% of people who participate in psychotherapy experience some type of benefit and can function better day to day.Studies also show that psychotherapy improves emotions and behaviors and is linked to positive changes in your brain and body.
