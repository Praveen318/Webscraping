However, men and people AMAB can also benefit from progestin in certain situations.Regulate your menstrual cycleProgesterone is one of the main reproductive hormones responsible for your menstrual cycle. Progestin supplements, in turn, can help normalize a person\u2019s menstrual cycle. This could include treating symptoms like irregular periods, heavy periods or not getting a period (amenorrhea). Progestin can also be a form of birth control (the minipill).Maintain a pregnancyProgestin is also a key hormone for maintaining a pregnancy.

Other forms of birth control contain both progestin and estrogen (also called combination birth control).
