A healthcare provider usually suggests percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) when other methods to pass a kidney stone are unsuccessful or not possible.\u201cPercutaneous\u201d means that the procedure occurs through the skin. \u201cNephrolithotomy\u201d means the removal of a calculus (kidney stone) from a kidney.Is PCNL a major surgery?Though PCNL is a minimally invasive surgery that has fewer complications, less impact on your body and allows you to heal faster than open surgery, it\u2019s still a major surgery.Who is the best candidate for percutaneous nephrolithotomy?Most kidney stones pass on their own and don\u2019t require surgery. A healthcare provider may initially suggest shock wave lithotripsy or laser ureteroscopy if you have a smaller kidney stone that can\u2019t pass on its own. The best candidate for PCNL is someone who can\u2019t pass a kidney stone on their own, and their stone is too big to treat with shock wave lithotripsy or laser ureteroscopy.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

PolicyHow is percutaneous nephrolithotomy done?A urologist performs percutaneous nephrolithotomy. A urologist is a healthcare provider who specializes in surgical conditions and diseases that affect your urinary tract. They\u2019ll make a small incision (cut) in your back or side to access your kidneys and remove the kidney stone.What is the success rate of percutaneous nephrolithotomy?Percutaneous nephrolithotomy has a success rate of approximately 75% to 98%.How often are percutaneous nephrolithotomies performed?Between 2007 and 2017, urologists performed nearly 20,000 PCNLs.

They\u2019ll check your general health and take your vitals (temperature, pulse and blood pressure).Tell your healthcare provider about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications you\u2019re taking. These include herbal supplements. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs, certain herbal supplements and blood thinners can increase your risk of bleeding. Be sure to check with a healthcare provider before stopping any medications.Tell your healthcare provider about any allergies you have, as well. Include all known allergies. These include medications, skin cleaners like iodine or isopropyl alcohol, latex and foods.Your healthcare provider will also give you specific directions on eating and drinking before your PCNL. You shouldn\u2019t eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery.

The team typically includes:A urologist.An anesthesiologist.Nurses.During most PCNL procedures, you\u2019ll lie on your stomach (prone), so the urologist can access your kidney through your back. However, the urologist may position you on your back (supine) or on your back with a cushion under your flank (modified supine).The anesthesiologist will sedate you (put you under) with general anesthesia. You won\u2019t be awake, won\u2019t move and won\u2019t feel any pain during the procedure.Once you\u2019re asleep, the urologist will make a small (approximately 1 cm or smaller) incision. They\u2019ll insert a protective sleeve (sheath) through the incision and into your kidney. They\u2019ll then insert a small video camera (nephroscope) into the sheath to locate and remove the kidney stone. In some cases, the urologist may use a laser or shock-wave device (lithotripter) to break the stone into smaller pieces before removing it.After removing the kidney stone, the urologist may install a drainage tube or a ureteral stent. These help drain urine (pee) and promote healing. They may then use stitches to close your skin incisions.How long does PCNL take?PCNL usually takes two to four hours to perform.What happens after PCNL?After PCNL, a healthcare provider will cover your stitches with bandages.They may also send the kidney stone to a lab so technicians can determine its composition.

You\u2019ll be conscious (awake) within a few minutes, but you\u2019ll likely still feel groggy.You\u2019ll then move to a recovery room. Healthcare providers will wait for you to wake up more fully and track your overall health. Once you fully wake up, providers will treat your pain.
