The pericardium isn\u2019t essential for normal heart function. Removing the pericardium doesn\u2019t cause problems as long as your lungs and diaphragm (the large muscle below your lungs) are intact.If you have pericarditis, your pericardium already has lost its lubricating ability. Removing it doesn\u2019t make that worse.Why is a pericardiectomy done?The most common reason for performing a pericardiectomy is constrictive pericarditis, a condition in which your pericardium becomes stiff and possibly calcified.This stiffness prevents your heart from stretching as it normally does when it beats.Then:Your heart chambers fill incompletely with blood.Blood backs up from your heart into your lungs.Your heart can\u2019t pump normally.Your legs and abdomen may swell.Symptoms of heart failure.For the most advanced cases of constrictive pericarditis, surgical treatment is the best option.Constrictive pericarditis causes include:\u201cIdiopathic,\u201d which means unknown cause.Previous heart surgery.Radiation to the chest.Diseases such as tuberculosis and mesothelioma.Viral or bacterial infection.Pericardiectomy also treats people with:Recurrent (symptoms that keep coming back) pericarditis.Complications of anti-inflammatory medications (including steroids) given for less severe pericardium constriction.Rarely, cardiac tamponade. This is a collection of fluid that presses on your heart.AdvertisementHow common are pericardiectomies?Pericardiectomies are rare surgeries. Even a hospital that does more pericardiectomies than most may only have 30 to 50 cases per year.About 20% of people with constrictive pericarditis in the United States end up getting a pericardiectomy.Procedure DetailsWhat happens before a pericardiectomy?Your healthcare team will make sure equipment is ready for a safe operation. Most often, your surgeon will use cardiopulmonary bypass (the heart/lung machine). This allows them to safely remove the pericardium from the sides and back of your heart.AdvertisementWhat happens during a pericardiectomy?Your surgical team will:Make an incision through your breastbone (sternum) in the middle front part of your ribs that allows them to reach your heart. This is called a median sternotomy.Remove the pericardium from your heart.Wire your breastbone and ribs back together.Close the incision with stitches.Is pericardiectomy open-heart surgery?Yes, pericardiectomy is usually open-heart surgery. -This allows your surgeon to get to your heart to remove your entire pericardium. Surgeons prefer this to a partial pericardiectomy technique.Some surgeons may use a thoracotomy approach, which means they make a cut between your ribs to get to your heart. Few use a minimally invasive approach because it limits how much of the pericardium your surgeon can reach.How long does pericardiectomy surgery take?On average, a pericardiectomy takes about two to three hours. However, some people have more than one procedure while they\u2019re in the operating room.What happens after a pericardiectomy surgery?You will feel sore when you wake up after your surgery.
