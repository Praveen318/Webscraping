Your diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of your lungs. It does most of the work when you breathe. If you have a lung condition, your diaphragm doesn\u2019t work as well. As a result, your body uses muscles in your neck, shoulders and back to compensate. These muscles aren\u2019t as good at moving air in and out of your lungs. Belly breathing retrains your diaphragm to do most of the breathing work again.Pursed lip breathing is easier to perform than belly breathing. It\u2019s a simple technique that slows your breathing pace and makes each breath more effective in bringing new oxygen into your lungs and getting stale air out.

It\u2019s a good idea to practice when you\u2019re not out of breath.Take a break if you feel dizzy or tired during pursed lip breathing.
