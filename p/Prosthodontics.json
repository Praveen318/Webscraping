You might need a crown if you have extensive decay or a cracked tooth, or if you\u2019ve recently had a root canal.Dental bridgesA dental bridge replaces one or more missing teeth in a row. This dental prosthetic consists of two crowns on either side with artificial teeth (pontics) in between them. Once placed, your natural teeth anchor the crowns, and the pontics fill the gap in your smile.DenturesThere are two main types of dentures: partial and full. Partial dentures replace several sporadically missing teeth. Full dentures replace a full arch of missing teeth. These removable appliances help restore the function and appearance of your smile.Inlays and onlaysIf a tooth is too damaged for a filling but not damaged enough to warrant a crown, then you might need an inlay or onlay. These custom restorations fit into your tooth structure like tiny puzzle pieces.Dental implantsDental implants are tiny threaded posts used to replace missing teeth roots. They\u2019re made from surgical-grade titanium or ceramic. Your dental provider places them into your jawbone.
