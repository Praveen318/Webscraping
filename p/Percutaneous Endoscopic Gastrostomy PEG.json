Your healthcare team may recommend changes to:Insulin dosage.Medicines that thin your blood, such as warfarin (Coumadin\u00ae).Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin (Bayer\u00ae) or ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae or Motrin\u00ae).Don't eat or drink at least eight hours before the surgery. You also need to arrange a ride home after surgery.AdvertisementWhat happens during percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy?Most healthcare providers place PEG tubes with endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic procedures use small incisions and a long, flexible instrument called an endoscope.On the day of surgery, you receive intravenous (IV) anesthesia and antibiotics. The anesthesia ensures that you remain calm and numb during the procedure. The antibiotic prevents infection.You may also receive a local anesthetic. A local anesthetic is an injection of numbing medicine. You receive this injection near where your surgeon makes the incision.During percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, your provider:Makes a small incision in your upper abdomen.Places the tube through the incision.Connects the tube to your stomach.The entire procedure only takes around 20 to 30 minutes. Usually, you can return home the same day or the next morning.What happens after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy?You\u2019ll feel some pain after a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. This pain might be from the incision. Or you might have cramping from gas buildup in your digestive system. This pain should decrease within 24 to 48 hours.You\u2019ll have a bandage over the incision site. You may see some drainage around the incision for up to 48 hours. Usually, your surgeon will give you instructions to remove the bandage after one to two days.After the area around your feeding tube heals, you\u2019ll meet with a dietitian. This specialist explains how to use the PEG tube and starts you on enteral nutrition.AdvertisementCan you see the PEG tube outside the body after surgery?Yes. PEG tubes are about the size of a pen or pencil. You\u2019ll see 6 to 12 inches of the tube coming out of the incision area. Around the tube is a disc called an external bumper. This bumper prevents the tube from going further into your stomach.At the end of the feeding tube is a small cap or plug. This plug prevents stomach acid or contents from leaking onto your skin or clothes. You can open this plug to receive food, water or medications.Risks / BenefitsWhat are the advantages of PEG tubes?PEG tubes are an important treatment if you have difficulty swallowing or are unable to get adequate nutrition.

You\u2019ll need to clean your PEG tube daily to decrease your risk of complications.Recovery and OutlookWhat is the outlook after a G tube placement?Most people with G tubes have no problems or complications after surgery. However, your outlook depends on the underlying medical condition that led to tube placement.Can I eat and drink by mouth with a PEG tube?After tube placement, most people receive fluids and liquid nutrition through the tube. People who need PEG tubes because of swallowing problems have restrictions on eating and drinking by mouth. Some people may still eat and drink small amounts through the mouth.
