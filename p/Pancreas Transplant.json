It produces insulin, a hormone that helps your body use sugar (glucose) for energy. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas makes little to no insulin. People with Type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to help control blood glucose levels.Sometimes insulin injections are not enough to control diabetes. Eventually, a lack of insulin and uncontrolled high glucose levels can cause damage throughout your body.Kidney disease is one of the most severe complications of Type 1 diabetes. Most people who are eligible for a pancreas transplant also have kidney failure. A pancreas transplant is often performed at the same time as a kidney transplant.With a healthy pancreas from a transplant, a person with diabetes can begin to produce insulin (insulin independence).AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
