This plaque build-up is atherosclerosis. In an atherectomy, healthcare providers remove plaque with a catheter with a sharp blade or laser on its end. The sharp blade or laser lets them cut out or scrape out the hard plaque. Your provider may also perform angioplasty (ballooning) or stent placement.How common are atherectomies?In the U.S., about 6.5 million people ages 40 and older have PAD. Researchers estimate that healthcare providers in the U.S. perform more than 190,000 atherectomies annually.What are the types of atherectomies?All atherectomies remove plaque buildup from your arteries. Healthcare providers may use different types of blades or use lasers to remove plaque:Excisional atherectomy: A blade cuts plaque in one direction.Laser ablation atherectomy: A laser destroys plaque.Orbital atherectomy: A spinning tool works like sandpaper to remove plaque.Rotational atherectomy: Tiny blades cut plaque in a circular motion.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
