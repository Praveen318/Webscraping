Healthcare providers (usually a surgeon specializing in urology) can use it to treat your entire prostate or just a part.

Other names for it include prostate cryoablation and cryosurgery.Who can get prostate cryotherapy?Providers use cryotherapy on prostate cancer that hasn\u2019t spread outside your prostate, is slow-growing and has a low risk of spreading in the future. You might be eligible for prostate cryotherapy if:You don\u2019t want surgery or radiation.Your provider recommends against surgery and radiation.The cancer has come back after radiation treatment.It might provide pain relief or relief of other symptoms.How does prostate cryotherapy work?Prostate cryotherapy works by using argon gas to cool tumor cells to a temperature cold enough to destroy them (-40 degrees Celsius). A provider inserts needles (cryoprobes) directly into the tumor to apply the gas. They use a transrectal ultrasound to help guide the needles and monitor how well an ice ball is developing.After the ice ball forms, they use helium gas to thaw out the cells. This first freeze-thaw cycle weakens the cells. The provider performs at least one additional freeze-thaw cycle to destroy the cells.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.
