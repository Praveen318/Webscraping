Exposure is a medical emergency. If you think you\u2019ve been exposed to HIV \u2014 through sex, sexual assault, shared needles or a work-related needle stick \u2014 go to the nearest emergency room or seek emergency medical attention.PEP is only meant for emergencies.

PolicyProcedure DetailsWhat happens before starting PEP?Before or while you start treatment, your provider might take samples of your blood, pee (urine) or other body fluids to run tests. They\u2019ll test you for HIV and look for conditions that might change what PEP medications you take or the doses you\u2019re prescribed. They might test you for:Hepatitis B.Hepatitis C.Pregnancy.How well your liver and kidneys function.Will I be tested or treated for any other infections when I\u2019m at my PEP visit?Yes, because multiple sexually transmitted infections can be transmitted at the same time. Based on the type of exposure you had, your provider may also test and/or treat you for other sexually transmitted infections, like:Gonorrhea.Chlamydia.Trichomoniasis.How does post-exposure prophylaxis work?PEP medications are antiretroviral drugs that work by preventing HIV from making more copies of itself. Each medication uses a different method or stops HIV at a different point in its replication process. Combining medications that work in different ways makes the treatment more effective.If you use antiretroviral medications early enough, they can stop an HIV infection before it has a chance to establish an infection in your body. When this happens, medications can\u2019t fully get rid of it and it becomes a chronic infection.AdvertisementWhat medications are used for post-exposure prophylaxis?Providers prescribe a combination of antiretroviral medications for PEP. These are the same kinds of medications used to treat HIV. They come in a pill that you swallow. You\u2019ll take a combined pill of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF, Truvada\u00ae) or a combined pill of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, Descovy\u00ae) plus one of the following:Raltegravir/RAL (Isentress, Isentress HD).Dolutegravir/DTG (Tivicay\u2122, Tivicay PD).A combination of darunavir/DRV (Prezista\u00ae) and ritonavir/RTV (Norvir\u00ae) or cobicistat/COBI.Depending on the medication, you might take these pills once or twice a day \u2014 make sure you understand the correct schedule. Ask your provider to explain it before you start PEP. Your provider may adjust the dose or types of medications depending on other health conditions you have.How long after HIV exposure can you take post-exposure prophylaxis?You need to start post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV no later than 72 hours (three days) after:Unprotected vaginal or anal sex (including forcible sex or assault) with someone who has or might have HIV.Sharing a needle (for instance, while injecting nonmedical drugs) with someone who has or might have HIV.Being exposed at work (for instance, if you were stuck by a needle contaminated with HIV).How long will I need to take post-exposure prophylaxis?You need to take PEP medications every day for the full 28 days for them to be effective. If you stop taking them too soon or skip doses, it increases your chances of getting an HIV infection.Who shouldn\u2019t take PEP?PEP isn\u2019t recommended if:It\u2019s been longer than 72 hours (three days) since your exposure.

You don\u2019t need to take PEP if you\u2019ve already been taking pre-exposure prophylaxis consistently.You\u2019re not likely to be infected. Oral sex and exposure to body fluids like spit, sweat and tears are unlikely to transmit HIV.AdvertisementWhat happens after PEP treatment?After PEP treatment, you should get repeat HIV testing at four to six weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after exposure. If your exposure is from sexual contact, you may also have repeat screening for other sexually transmitted diseases at four to six weeks after exposure. Please follow up with your primary care provider for this testing.Risks / BenefitsHow well does post-exposure prophylaxis work?Studies suggest that PEP reduces your risk of getting HIV by over 80%.

They include:Fatigue.Nausea.Vomiting.Diarrhea.Headaches.These side effects can be managed with over-the-counter medications in most cases.

You can go to:An emergency room (ER), accidents and emergency (A&E) or other emergency medical center that can give you immediate attention.A sexual health clinic.Some primary care providers or family doctors will prescribe PEP. But they might refer you to another provider or the ER, depending on how much experience they have with it.If you\u2019re seeking care for a sexual assault, you may see a sexual assault nurse examiner who can provide evidence collection, counseling and follow-up. Most emergency departments offer these services.Wherever you seek care, if they require an appointment, tell them why you need to be seen and that it\u2019s important to get in immediately. If they can\u2019t see you right away, they should be able to tell you where to go for immediate care.What questions should I ask my doctor?It\u2019s very important to take PEP medications exactly as directed.

They can discuss your options with you.Can I have sex while taking PEP?If you have vaginal or anal sex while taking PEP, it\u2019s safest to use a condom or other barrier contraception to protect your partner until you know you don\u2019t have HIV.Is post-exposure prophylaxis used for preventing other diseases?Most of the time, you hear about post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. There are also post-exposure treatments for other infectious diseases. Depending on the disease, the treatment usually includes vaccine or antibody (immunoglobulin) shots.
