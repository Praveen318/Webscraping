Phosphate is a mineral that helps with several functions in your body, but if you have too much of it in your bloodstream, it can cause problems. Your healthcare provider may recommend phosphate binders as treatment.Phosphate binders are available over-the-counter or by prescription from a healthcare provider. You shouldn\u2019t take phosphate binders without first talking to a healthcare provider.Another name for phosphate binders is phosphorus binders.What does phosphate do?Phosphate is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are minerals that have a natural positive or negative charge when dissolved in water or other body fluids, such as blood. Your body needs phosphate to help form your bones and teeth. It also helps your cells produce energy and form cell membranes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).Your body gets phosphates through the foods or drinks you ingest. Whatever phosphates your body doesn\u2019t absorb leaves your body through your urine (pee) or poop. If your body doesn\u2019t release the extra phosphate, it can build up in your blood or kidneys and create issues.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Phosphate binders help prevent the progression of bone disorders that develop from hyperphosphatemia (chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, or CKD-MBD).What is a typical phosphate level?A typical phosphate level for adults is between 2.8 and 4.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A typical phosphate level for children is between 4.0 to 7.0 mg/dL. However, different laboratories may use different measuring techniques. Ask your healthcare provider to explain your phosphate levels and their measuring techniques.What foods are high in phosphate?The following foods and drinks have high levels of phosphates:Dairy, including milk, processed cheeses and yogurt.Soda pop.Fast food.Snack foods.Processed meats.Nuts.Beans.Lentils.Whole grains, including wheat, oats and rice.Are phosphate binders commonly prescribed?Yes, healthcare providers commonly prescribe phosphate binders to treat hyperphosphatemia.What drugs are phosphate binders?There are many different types of phosphate binders. They include:Calcium carbonate (Alka-Seltzer\u00ae or Tums\u00ae).Sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro\u00ae).Sevelamer (Renvela\u00ae or Renagel\u00ae).Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol\u00ae).Calcium acetate (PhosLo\u00ae, Phoslyra\u00ae, Eliphos\u00ae or Calphron\u00ae).What is a good phosphate binder?Healthcare providers commonly recommend calcium carbonate. However, medical research suggests that phosphate binders that contain calcium may increase the risk of mineral deposits on the walls of your blood vessels (vascular calcifications). Vascular calcifications increase your risk of developing blood clots or strokes. Because of this risk, your provider may recommend a phosphate binder that doesn\u2019t contain calcium, such as sevelamer.What is a natural phosphate binder?Healthcare providers once thought niacin (vitamin B3) and chitosan chewing gum could naturally reduce phosphates in your blood. But medical research shows that chitosan chewing gum doesn\u2019t reduce phosphate levels, and niacin alone can\u2019t adequately reduce phosphate absorption.AdvertisementProcedure DetailsHow do I take phosphate binders?Before taking a phosphate binder, tell your healthcare provider about any prescription or over-the-counter medications you\u2019re taking.

The jejunum is the middle part of your small intestine, after your stomach. When you take phosphate binders with meals or snacks, they attach (bind) to extra phosphates in your stomach before they reach your jejunum, which prevents some phosphates from entering your blood. The extra phosphate then leaves your body when you poop.How long will I need to take phosphate binders?Talk to a healthcare provider.
